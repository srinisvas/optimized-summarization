The ETHAI methodology developed and implemented within the COMFORTage project demonstrates a promising approach to bridging the persistent gap between abstract ethical principles and concrete technical implementation in AI systems for healthcare.
Second, possible privacy vulnerabilities raise questions about protecting sensitive patient data.
It finally presents some partial results and lessons learnt.
The timing of ethics integration emerged as a crucial factor.
Autonomy and Oversight.
These range from mapping relevant characteristics of a system to identify potential gaps and issues to determining targets for further study, scrutiny, or monitoring.
This proactive approach represents a shift from traditional reactive care models.
The study employs multiple assessment approaches including oral health evaluations, neuroimaging techniques to assess brain activity, and cognitive assessments.
The scope dimension regards the breadth of an AI system inquiry.
This experience reveals that effective ethics sensitive AI development requires not merely translation but coconstruction of requirements through sustained interdisciplinary dialogue.
Within industry settings, commercial pressures and rapid development cycles often hamper ethical implementation despite genuine intentions.
A distinguishing feature of the project is its implementation of data-driven assistive technologies that process multiple data streams to provide appropriate support and monitoring capabilities, balancing independent living with safety considerations.
For example, in contexts involving older adults with mental health conditions, clinicians, caregivers, and patients' families possess privileged perspectives on the care journey and its challenges.
As a preliminary result of developers-ethicists collaboration, consider requirement R1.
This inventory was designed as an iterative practice, updated throughout the project as changes occurred.
This case study contributes valuable empirical evidence to the field of applied AI ethics and design, where practical implementation experiences remain underreported despite their importance for advancing responsible technology development.
Conclusions are drawn in Section V.
The process unfolds through four interconnected phases that form a continuous cycle.
Technical partners noted they were accustomed to receiving requirements from users rather than co-designing them with ethics specialists.
The semi-structured approach here adopted proved advantageous, if compared to a rigid methodology.
While the methodology's theoretical foundation has been detailed elsewhere , the focus in this paper is more on its implementation aspects..
