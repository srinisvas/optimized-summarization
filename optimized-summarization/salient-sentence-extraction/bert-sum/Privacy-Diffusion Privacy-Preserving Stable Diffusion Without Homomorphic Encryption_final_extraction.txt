Privacy-Diffusion is a privacy-preserving diffusion framework that protects both the privacy of the client and the server.
This method can be extended to other generative machinelearning models with similar structures.
We conclude in Section VII.
Definition 1 (Text Encoder): A text encoder , Table I shows execution times.
Starting from • • • They optimize performance using partial encryption, image division, and sparse encryption.
CryptoNets first applied HE to neural networks.
Results are generated by stable diffusion model v1.4 with a DDIM scheduler at 512x512 resolution.
• No Quality Loss: Our protocol does not use differential privacy or approximations, maintaining highquality image output.
We benchmark on an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPU, 128GB RAM, and an NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti GPU.
• κ: The security parameter.
• x t : The image in pixel space X at iteration t.
• • T: The number of iterations to perform denoising.
Denoise: The algorithm used to reduce the noise.
Many artists and service providers customize the diffusion model for special textures.
Text-to-image generation is a key area in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)..
