The comprehensive framework proposed in this work addresses the ethical and legal implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in business and employment, with a specific focus on privacy, bias, and accountability 𝐴𝐹(𝑅𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑠, 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠) -Data Decryption: Depicts the reverse process, where encrypted data is decrypted back to its original form for decision-making.
Understanding and addressing these concerns are crucial for establishing a responsible and trustworthy AI ecosystem.
Moreover, the pervasive issue of algorithmic bias has garnered significant attention.
Brown and Miller (2017) assert that current laws are often ill-equipped to deal with the complexity of AI technologies, necessitating legislative updates.
The high privacy preservation percentage signifies the robustness of the encryption techniques employed.
This strategy aims to foster fairness and equity in AI decision-making across various demographic groups.
This safeguards sensitive information, offering a balance between data utility and individual privacy.
The accountability gap in AI systems poses another critical challenge.
The integration of AI technologies into decision-making processes holds immense potential for efficiency and innovation.
However, this rapid adoption has also given rise to ethical dilemmas and legal uncertainties.
Mathematical Modeling and Equations: Our accountability mechanisms involve the development of explain ability modules and the establishment of frameworks that define roles and responsibilities.
As AI continues to evolve, a steadfast commitment to ethical considerations is imperative for building trust and ensuring the responsible and equitable deployment of AI technologies.
The proposed mechanisms aim to address the opacity associated with many AI systems, enabling stakeholders to understand and scrutinize the decision logic while holding individuals and organizations accountable for the outcomes.
As AI algorithms analyse and interpret this data to make informed decisions, the risk of privacy infringements becomes a pressing issue.
Research by Chen and Wang (2021) highlights the need for a holistic approach, acknowledging that addressing one aspect in isolation may not be sufficient.
2019) argue that transparency is essential for establishing accountability, emphasizing the need for interpretability in complex AI models.
The proposed work envisions a cohesive implementation model, spanning data processing, algorithm development, decision-making processes, continuous monitoring, and documentation.
The bias detection accuracy showcases the system's ability to accurately identify and address biases.
Let's denote the explain ability function as , the accountability 𝐸𝑋 framework as , and the AI decision function as.
As organizations increasingly integrate AI technologies into their operations, the ethical and legal implications of such advancements have become subjects of paramount concern..
