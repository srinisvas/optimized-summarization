Students are encouraged to map each "wish" in the story to modern examples of AI misbehavior-such as systems that optimize narrow objectives while neglecting social context.
Technical instruction often prioritizes system functionality and performance, leaving limited space for ethical analysis or value-sensitive design.
Stories like The Monkey's Paw offer a unique, highimpact avenue for addressing key issues in AI alignment and responsible innovation.
To bridge this gap, narrative-based ethics education offers an accessible and engaging format for exploring the complex human dimensions of AI.
The session can conclude with reflective writing on how to prevent such outcomes in future technologies.
This method supports active learning while requiring minimal logistical overhead.
A typical lesson plan might allocate time for in-class reading, followed by guided ethical discussion and applied reflection.
Its open-ended interpretation encourages students from varied backgrounds to consider how intention, design, and consequence interact in both fictional and real-world systems.
Its emotional impact and narrative resonance help foster lasting ethical awareness, which is often more difficult to achieve through abstract principles alone.
Instructors can further relate these discussions to ethical frameworks such as IEEE's Ethically Aligned Design, which emphasizes transparency, human well-being, and responsibility in intelligent systems.
The symbolic nature of the tale provides fertile ground for examining themes such as control, moral agency, and technological risk.
The story's concise format (readable in under 15 minutes) allows it to be used during a single class session.
The story's brevity, metaphorical richness, and public availability make it a practical resource for stimulating discussion around AI alignment and social impact.
Ethics education in AI must move beyond theoretical discussion to engage learners in reflective, multidisciplinary inquiry.
While these challenges are recognized in AI safety research, structured opportunities to explore them in engineering classrooms remain rare.
When paired with structured facilitation, such narratives can prepare students to think more critically about the values embedded in technology and the consequences of their design choices.
A classroom strategy is outlined to demonstrate how narrative tools can complement technical learning and promote ethical reflection among future developers and users.
The rise of autonomous AI agents introduces complex ethical concerns, particularly regarding value alignment, unintended consequences, and system accountability.
Misalignments between design goals and real-world outcomes can lead to harms such as reward manipulation, biased decisions, or unintended escalation effects ,.
One such narrative approach draws on The Monkey's Paw, a short story in which a family is granted three wishes, each fulfilled through literal but devastating outcomes ..
