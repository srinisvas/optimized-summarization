Based on evaluation of access control policies, of the client's browser cryptographic capabilities and of client's authentication method, Active Bundle responds to the requesting service with the authorized data.
Researcher can given in table 1.
Demo video for our prototype is available.
It provides protection against eavesdropping attacks.
Decryption key derivation procedure is similar to encryption key derivation.
This approach relies on centralized TTP to manage keys, metadata, joining and leaving brokers.
A mechanism which guarantees that unauthorized data accesses are denied is needed.
If the Web Cryptography API is supported, a 'secure authentication' is enabled that uses a protocol beyond just usernames and passwords.
Client's network (trusted vs.
unknown network).
Data and policies are made inseparable.
only access anonymized records of patients, i.e.
medical and billing information.
Access control policies can be specified either using Javascript Object Notation (JSON) or Extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) policy language.
WSO2 Balana is used for policy evaluation.
Micro-policies are specified in terms of tags, used to label URLs, network connections, cookies, etc; and a transfer function, which monitors security-relevant operations based on these tags and defines which operations are permitted by the browser.
The mechanism, implemented as a Google Chrome extension Michrome , can be used to ensure secure access to web data by means of http(s) protocol.
Assumptions: Hardware on a site where AB is hosted / executed is trusted.
Detailed configuration setup can be found in the prototype tutorial.
Active Bundle with embedded tamper -resistance mechanism is evaluated.
A mechanism of micro-policies enforced at a browser's side was proposed to provide confidentiality and integrity of web sessions.
Such operations have limited ability to express access control policies..
