This research approach will be designed and implemented using the development of AI-generated privacy-preserving protocols for improving data security in cross-cloud environments.
More advanced approaches, like ABE, can enable flexible, role-based access control, reducing various risks against unauthorized access.
On the other hand, SMC enables joint processing without sharing raw information.
• That would ensure efficient use of computing powers during high-demand conditions.
At the same time, differential privacy investigates protection at an individual record level by adding noise at a statistical level.
The following critical metrics employed are summarized in Table 1: • Attack Resistance: The percentage of simulated attacks detected and contained.
Even supported by automated AIbased checks, achieving standardized privacy practices across these many jurisdictions can remain insurmountable.
Besides this, scalability and performance problems also arise from conventional methods.
Reliability grows with the quality of the training data.
The module discussed here continuously monitors contextual parameters such as user roles, application usage, and geographic location and updates the security policies accordingly.
Each runs under a different security protocol and data governance framework that complicates uniform mechanisms of privacy implementation.
While it is very promising in theory, because of the high computational costs, it is far from realistic for big deployments over the cloud.
Finally, differential privacy techniques need optimization in balancing privacy and data utility to make data analytics effective and protect sensitive information.
Such architecture will comprise different modules interdependent on one another in runtime data exchange protection.
However, they create a lot of obstacles in cross-cloud scenarios owing to computational overheads and fundamental management complexities.
This testbed setting comprises three major cloud providers with different security policies and multiple data management frameworks.
Artificial intelligence has been the transformative force for a new definition of methodology concerning privacypreserving in cloud data sharing.
For example, the latency of the proposed protocol is minimal, around 50ms compared to SMC and ABE, with 120ms and 150ms, respectively.
Models must be refreshed to nullify false positives and omit open vulnerabilities in cloud environments characterized by dynamically changing re-emerging threats and data types.
Second, enhancing model aggregation techniques within federated learning reduces the communication overhead between participating cloud environments, which is a desirable outcome, especially in large-scale deployments..
