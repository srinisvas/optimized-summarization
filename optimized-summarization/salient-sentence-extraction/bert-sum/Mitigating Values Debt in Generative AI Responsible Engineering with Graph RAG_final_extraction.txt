This paper examines Values Debt in Generative AI and introduces the Helpful, Honest, Harmless (HHH) framework to align AI systems with human values.
By analyzing ASRS safety narratives, GRAISE offers concise, actionable insights that directly support pilot training objectives.
Semantic rules and constraints ensure consistent and precise data representation, while optimizing external knowledge enhances retrieval efficiency and relevance.
GRAISE ensures respectful and professional interactions, preventing offensive or discriminatory content.
However, they also introduce critical ethical challenges, including biases, misinformation, and privacy risks.
Verification and Validation: Developing robust testing protocols for ethical compliance was essential in the verification and validation phase.
Graph RAG leverages this knowledge graph by employing community detection algorithms to group related entities into "communities." Helpful: GRAISE assists pilots by delivering personalized feedback from real-world incident reports, enhancing communication and decision-making skills.
By adopting these practices, organizations across various domains can contribute to building public trust in AI technologies.
In the field of education, ensuring that the knowledge graph includes diverse curricular content can help AI tutors provide equitable learning experiences, promoting fairness in educational guidance.
Balancing Technical Feasibility with Ethics: Implementing HHH principles may demand extra resources and could affect system performance.
Potential misinformation tied to GPT-4's broader training data is monitored, and safeguards help detect misuse.
It avoids harmful or misleading advice through reliance on validated data and adherence to safety protocols.
This grounding can significantly reduce instances of hallucinations and misinformation prevalent in conventional LLMs.
Through proactive governance and careful stewardship, the development of generative AI can enhance societal well-being while maintaining ethical integrity.
The GRAISE case study exemplifies the practical application of these principles and methodologies.
Weighing these factors early in the design phase ensures that ethical imperatives remain central, even under resource constraints.
The following outlines how GRAISE aligns with each HHH principle:
 Similarly, Google's internal conflicts over ethical AI practices, highlighted by the departure of AI researcher Timnit Gebru, reveal organizational tensions from misaligned values.
Generative AI (GenAI) technologies like GPT-4 and DALL.E have transformed industries by automating tasks such as content creation, language translation, and data analysis.
Reputational and Legal Implications: Values Debt can lead to reputational harm, legal challenges, and loss of consumer trust..
