This study applied CPM theory to examine the privacy perspectives of young digital citizens, parents/educators, and AI developers/researchers using five key validated constructs: Data Ownership and Control (DOC), Parental Data Sharing (PDS), Perceived Risks and Benefits (PRB), Transparency and Trust (TT), and Education and Awareness (EA).
• H11: Misuse becomes inevitable" (#Participant 4).
Privacy Boundaries: Symbolic boundaries that assist people regulate what they share by separating private information from public information.
P-values assess the statistical significance of these relationships.
EA scored 0.622, also reflecting moderate reliability.
Participation was entirely voluntary and did not receive any form of compensation.
We recruited participants through flyers, emails, personal networks, and on social networking sites, LinkedIn, and Reddit.
For data processing, Microsoft Excel was employed to manage the collected data through descriptive statistics.
Furthermore, PRB plays a critical role in shaping how youth decide whether to disclose personal information to AI systems.
The revised research model was then assessed by gathering survey data.
This emphasizes the necessity of looking into the variables affecting how youth handle their privacy to improve policy frameworks, educational initiatives, and AI design methodologies.
One educator criticized the excessive demand for data, stating, "AI systems ask for too much data, more than they need to serve their purpose" (#Participant 5).
Employing a mixed-methods approach, the research combined quantitative data from structured questionnaires with qualitative insights from open-ended responses.
Transparent practices, such as simplified disclosures and privacy summaries tailored to youths, can enhance understanding and trust, ultimately reducing boundary turbulence.
Our quantitative survey used a 5-point Likert scale to compare mean responses across five key constructs, as shown in Fig.
Research highlights that higher levels of digital literacy are associated with more cautious and thoughtful online behavior among youth, reinforcing the importance of education in promoting responsible digital engagement.
In contrast, PDS exhibits a significant negative impact on DOC (β = -0.170; p < 0.01), leading us to partially reject H6 as the effect, though significant, is negative.
These technologies undoubtedly have benefits, but they also pose serious problems concerning data ownership, privacy, and ethical use of personal data.
Additionally, the crosssectional design only offers a snapshot in time, constraining our ability to make causal inferences and capture the evolving nature of privacy attitudes and behaviors.
We employed the path-weighing structural model scheme in smartPLS which provides the highest R 2 values for dependent latent variables..
