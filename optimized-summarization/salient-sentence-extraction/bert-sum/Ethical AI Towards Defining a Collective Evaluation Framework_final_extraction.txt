This article addresses key challenges in ethical AI and aims to:
Propose a unified system for monitoring AI outcomes in line with the EU AI Act and emerging global regulations.
• If cross-references are weak, human oversight is required.
Ontological blocks translate ethical concepts into structured, quantifiable forms.
Goodall advocates for programming rules that minimize harm during unavoidable accidents.
• FAIR principles enhance discoverability, usability, and scalability.
These modular units enable transparent evaluations across diverse ethical contexts.
This creates a personalized, behavior-informed investor classification framework.
Lack of explainability can erode trust, particularly in lifecritical applications.
The proposed structure is simple: a primary concept paired with a binary ethical qualifier (e.g., good or bad).
Transparency: Promotes understandable, open AI processes AI Application Areas: Domains where ethical principles are applied.
They include:
Fairness: Prevents bias and ensures equitable treatment.
The article is organized in five sections: Introduction (Section I), background (Section II), literature review (Section III), methodology and discussion (Section IV), then includes conclusion and recommendations (Section V).
• Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) offers a governance model that aligns AI with societal values -.
• Ontological blocks, drawing from Semantic Web standards , , provide scalable representations of principles like non-maleficence and equity.
• The EU champions "ethics-by-design," embedding ethics at the development stage.
examines scenarios like the trolley problem, calling for transparent ethical decision-making in critical moments.
As AI continues to integrate into society, the task of addressing these ethical dilemmas grows increasingly complex.
Another pressing issue is trustworthiness.
Integrating ethical AI into legally binding decisions requires acknowledging that legal standards vary significantly by context.
Reliance on large language models (LLMs) or external tools to infer missing relationships, introducing potential biases..
