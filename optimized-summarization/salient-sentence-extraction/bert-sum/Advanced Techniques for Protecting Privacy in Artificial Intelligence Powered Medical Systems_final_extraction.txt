Regularization techniques like stochastic gradient descent increase resilience.
These procedures remove medical record identifiers.
This dramatically improves privacy but might lower data value if done incorrectly.
Meanwhile, researchers are gathering and analyzing massive amounts of personal health data.
The system often does better than competitors on important tests, showing that it can better protect data privacy while still offering high value and speed.
