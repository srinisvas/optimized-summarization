During clinical trials, the valve showed material fatigue leading to weld fractures, causing sudden cardiac arrest and death in more than 600 reported cases.
Patients were usually exposed to low energy radiation treatments to gradually and safely remove any remaining cancerous growth.
Engineering instructors may access numerous documents and reports on the subject.
Another emblematic case for study in biomedical engineering is the Therac-25, a medical linear accelerator, jointly developed by the Canadian AECL and CGR, a French company to treat cancer patients.

FDA did not thoroughly investigate the manufacturer nor enforce patient notification.
Under certain circumstances, the patient could experience dangerously high pressure.
The rapid advancements in the field of medicine, achieved by biomedical scientist and engineers in the past decades, gave birth to new ethical problems that need to be addressed.
Students must be aware that once the problem is identified, a solution is possible.
While these traditional pedagogical techniques are commonly used, additional activities, such as implementing codes of ethics and student-developed scenarios, may be employed to encourage critical thinking ..
