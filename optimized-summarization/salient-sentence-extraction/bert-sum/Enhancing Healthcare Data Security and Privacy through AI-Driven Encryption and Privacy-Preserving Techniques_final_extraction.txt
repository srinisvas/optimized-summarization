Use of AI in encryption assures that data is secured to the level required depending on the nature of the data, the location where the data will be accessed, and who wants to access the data.
Homomorphic encryption has been applied in various examples of healthcare apps to secure health information during computation.
For instance, Barni et al.
( Our evaluations will therefore feed into fine tuning and improving the proposed methodology to offer a sound, as well as scalable, approach to HCP data protection and security.
These desirable conditions are often realized at the expense of lower data quality due to noise added under differential privacy or involves achieving a good balance between high privacy and data quality.
Some works using differential privacy in healthcare context have focused on protecting the identification of patients in a shared dataset.
The Methodology highlighted above of ensuring regulatory compliance with minimum interference ensures healthcare organizations have a perfect and comprehensive stop due to a proactive tool for meeting new paradigms of privacy laws.
Through training deep neural networks on pre-existing security data, IDS will be in a position to detect indicators of compromize or intrusion.
In sum, this methodology provides end-to-end and expandable solution to the ever emerging problem of protecting health care information in the age of digitalization.
A number of published works address the use of encryption technologies in safeguarding health information with research accomplishing progress within the field throughout the past several years.
However, despite the potential advantages offered employing these AI -based encryption schemes in healthcare, they remain relatively unproven and need to be deployed in extensive and real life healthcare scenarios.
Differential privacy was not relevant to the encryption time but was used along with other methods to safeguard the individual data point during the analysis phase.
However, the newer forms of security threats require higher levels of security, and traditional security means like use of encryptions and access control are greater deficits.
Chen et al explained that by integrating AI with reliable encryption and privacy protection methods, healthcare institutions workshop trusted and reliable systems that can address challenges in today's healthcare technology.
AI can then be used to improve the methods of threat detection, protection, and their prevention without violating user's privacy rights or legal standards for data security like HIPAA.
As pointed out, these types methods provide better flexibility and more effective computations by training on the patterns of the data and adjusting cryptographic key parameters on the fly.
The synergy of using encryption and privacy-preserving techniques that could be enabled by AI with the standards and guidelines particular to healthcare research is another research area.
Because federated learning restricts data transfers, it is less privacy intrusive than other solutions, and it had the highest cooperation rate.
The AI-based IDS has also been studied as part of the general effort to protect healthcare data.
As costly technologies such as cloud, AI, IoT continue to find their way in healthcare organizations, it becomes even more essential to ensure that those systems are built with security and privacy considerations in mind..
