To protect the privacy of personal data, the Laplace mechanism is used in conjunction with the fuzzy-based encryption to introduce noise into the dataset.
This study has considered 5000 edges and 1,000 vertices.
These days, information is gathered from several sources.
The input variables' input layer.
Since the public cloud cannot be trusted, data is encrypted before being stored.
Given and , the total number of occurrences.
In the conventional paradigm of cloud computing, edge devices often function as consumers.
The work is organized as: section 2 gives detailed explanation on prevailing approaches.
This suggests a loss of accuracy due to a compromise between privacy and accuracy.
This becomes illegitimate if.
When a system's uncertainty rises, the information entropy also rises.
It retrieves files from the cloud, performs index lookups using hash trees, and forwards queries to the data provider.
The weight of each edge is determined randomly.
A fuzzy system's architecture typically consists of the following components:
9 It means that there is better privacy protection, making it harder for an attacker to determine the exact position of the mobile user.
The proposed system involves two main processes: one for the data owner and another for the data analyst.
If participants in a group sensing task use their personal smartphones, the job requester's (server's) submitted sensor data may vary.
This approach feeds fuzzy membership functions, which are then combined with fuzzy logic.
As a result, in our approach, the information entropy , and the likelihood P of privacy in a location leaking can be characterized as
To assess the uncertainties of fuzzy model as a variable, We made use of different fixed and user grids' area ratios.
This is the request R that was sent to the data analyst.
Greater noise tends to increase privacy but it also decreases the precision ..
