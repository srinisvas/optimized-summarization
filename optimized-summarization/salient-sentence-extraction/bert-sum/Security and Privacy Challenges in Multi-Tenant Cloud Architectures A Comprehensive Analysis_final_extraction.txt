To address the identified security and privacy challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, we propose a conceptual framework that integrates tenant isolation, secure communication, access control, and continuous monitoring using Google Cloud components.
Tampering: Unauthorized modification of data or configurations.
Techniques include:
• AES-256 encryption for storage.
Implementing zero trust reduces lateral movement across tenants.
• It includes:
• • • • • • • • • • 6.
• • Known as ChaosDB, the vulnerability was resolved quickly by Microsoft.
Section V analyzes threat models and real-world incidents.
• Supports compliance with GDPR and HIPAA through auditability.
This shared model enables service providers to maximize resource utilization and reduce operational costs.
Because each tenant operates within an isolated GCP project, resources can be scaled independently.
• Data encryption is essential at every stage-at rest, in transit, and in use.
• Kubernetes namespaces and network policies for containerized workloads.
When cloud providers recycle storage blocks or fail to securely delete decommissioned resources, residual data from a previous tenant may persist.
Data packets transmitted across public networks can be intercepted unless Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunneling is used.
These components may introduce vulnerabilities into the ecosystem if not thoroughly vetted and regularly audited.
Tenants may become victims of resource starvation due to malicious tenants launching DoS attacks within the same infrastructure.
An exploration of current mitigation strategies and recommendations for future cloud governance.
Google Cloud provides features like VPC Service Controls, data loss prevention (DLP) APIs, and Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEKs) to enforce tenant data boundaries and prevent accidental leakage.
Encrypt all internal and external communication using VPN tunnels or service mesh frameworks (e.g., Istio).
These vulnerabilities are further exacerbated by the dynamic and elastic nature of cloud environments, where virtual machines (VMs) and containers are frequently instantiated, migrated, or terminated..
