While it cannot be stated that this is a measure of Computer Vision (hence AI partially) ethical impact -we should analyse the bunch of papers more in depth and understand the extent to which their content can contribute to the achievement of SDG targets -we believe this analysis reveals at least the extent of coincidence between Computer Vision research scope and the scope of SDGs.
They analysed 819 publications.
Overall, our investigation covers a temporal window ranging from 2018 to 2022.
for Society, Economy and Environment.
Particularly, the increase was observed in SDG3, SDG11, SDG12, SDG13, SDG14, SDG15, SDG16 (Fig.
An Ethics that takes meaningful account of both humans and nature as an inseparable and interconnecting parts.
presented a benchmark dataset for AI projects addressing SDGs.
The SDGs that have low impact are SDG16 (4.27%), SDG4 (2.10%), SDG8 (1.62%), SDG7 (1.43%) and SDG10 (0.67%).
Key Computer Vision functions are detection, recognition, classification, prediction and more recently image and video generation either starting from visual or text data.
The total number of papers considered for CVPR conferences is 4893, specifically 1466 in CVPR2020, 1661 in CVPR2021 and 1766 in CVPR2022.
This has made the European conference nearly the same size as the older and prestigious US-based conference.
They considered several main areas of AI, namely Knowledge Representation, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Automated Reasoning.
In parallel, the idea of Artificial Intelligence for Social Good is gaining traction within information societies, considering the potential of AI to address social problems effectively.
In the late 1970s, the so-called Ecological Ethics was defined, to which numerous important contributions were added, such as the Deep Ecology and the Responsibility Principles.
These progresses require to consider this technology with respect to its ethical impact, particularly on human rights, sustainable development, and planet earth.
Unfortunately, their research was of limited size: only 200 papers were analysed.
In general terms, AI systems must be as transparent, explainable, safe, robustness and reliable as possible and must also have clear evidence of trustworthiness and regulatory accountability.
In our research we analysed the ECCV2018, ECCV2020 and ECCV2022 editions.
Impact of CV on the SDGs has improved due to the increased use of CV in real applications over the years.
We did not observe any substantial difference between ECCV and CVPR..
