To investigate the ethical consequences related to the application of AI-driven predictive privacy mechanisms in V2X-6G networks.
   Artificial intelligence systems are able to glean useful information from massive datasets by using methods like pattern recognition and data mining.
Organizational and social advancement depend on people's capacity to make well-informed choices quickly and precisely.
Prepare guides tailored for different interviewee profiles to ensure relevant and comprehensive data collection.
Traditional static privacy measures often prove insufficient in dynamic and complex network environments.
The fine line between monitoring for security purposes and infringing on personal privacy is a contentious issue.
This learning capability is fundamental in staying ahead of cybercriminals who constantly develop new techniques to exploit data vulnerabilities.
Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and Scopus were among the sources of papers that were searched.
Nevertheless, there are ethical concerns and difficulties associated with this integration that must be thoroughly investigated.
Conversely, expert systems model their decisionmaking after human beings by drawing on expert knowledge.
Set up focus groups to talk more in-depth about collective attitudes and concerns about predictive privacy.
According to McCallister et al.
( 2020), AI can process large datasets efficiently while maintaining user privacy through automated systems that adhere to regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.
Future work could improve AI algorithms to limit AI biases, increase predictive privacy measures, and create real-time adaptability to risks that change over time.
They can be programmed to understand and interpret the nuances of legal frameworks from different regions and automatically apply these rules to the data they handle.
validated the use of SAS Predictive analytics is an area where AI methods, and ML algorithms in particular, shine.
This is very helpful in domains like quality control or risk assessment.
Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) offer promising solutions to these challenges.
I have been motivated to effectively finish my research and offer it to the environment in the appropriate format by the knowledge and awareness I have gained, as well as by the assistance and support of my mentors.
This shift is critical as businesses increasingly rely on data-driven decision-making processes that require rapid, yet secure, access to information..
