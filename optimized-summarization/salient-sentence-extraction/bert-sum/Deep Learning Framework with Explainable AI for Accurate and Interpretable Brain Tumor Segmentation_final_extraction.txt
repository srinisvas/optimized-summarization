In the proposed model, combining FL with XAI to create a model that balances privacy, interpretability, and diagnostic accuracy best for the improvement of validity and reliability in AI-driven systems of brain tumor detection.
Backward Pass This may happen by either focusing on specific features or through approximation techniques.
• Performance Metric: • • • A • Information is collected and stored locally at each participating site from MRI scans.
However, the current approach has a number of shortcomings.
The limitations will be addressed by further improving future work so that the system will further be extended.
All such indicators are analyzed for seeing how the system performs in these varied situations.
Federated Learning, which promises to offer privacy-friendly co-operative model training across institutions without sharing raw data, is emerging as a possible solution to these problems.
• Heatmap Generation: The weighted feature maps are combined to form a heatmap H, which highlights the areas in the image most relevant to the class prediction.
Despite these successes, the cost of transmission overhead makes it challenging to improve the real-time processing of federated models.
To improve model generalization across different tumour types and MRI techniques, including bigger and more diverse datasets can help.
• Explainable AI for transparent models using SHAP and LIME.
Their "black-box" nature poses significant challenges even though they achieve high accuracy, especially in clinical scenarios where interpretability is a concern.
This also shows how FL enables organisations to create cooperative models without disclosing private information.
The data processing and process flow of the system are easily comprehensible from this flowchart.
On top of that, real-time clinical integration will emphasize optimizing a system to fast, accurate predictions with detailed explanations able to fit a clinical workflow seamlessly.
Despite advances in technology, brain tumors remain the most common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and early diagnosis is key to effective treatment.
FL allows organizations to train models locally on the organization's data, and no data is exchanged during the training procedure.
Generalization Improvements: Some of the ways to overcome them include:
-Enhance the diversity and stability of the data set to do well for other MRI scans.
Addressing data heterogeneity and providing realtime complex explanations may help in creating adaptive and reliable AI models in real-world clinical settings.
Federated Learning Performance: Reflects the ability of a model to train in a group setting but keep itself private..
