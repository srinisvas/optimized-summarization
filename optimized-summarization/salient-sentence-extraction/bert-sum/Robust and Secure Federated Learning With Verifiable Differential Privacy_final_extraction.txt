In DPSFL, the global model update is computed as
w = w + s∈S t v s ,
where w is the aggregated model update from honest users and v s is the noise injected by secondary server s.
Under the Binomial Mechanism, the global model satisfies (ε, δ)-differential privacy with
ε = 10 1 t • n b ln 2 δ ,
where t is the threshold for secret reconstruction, and n b is the per-server noise parameter.
Practical Recommendations: Based on these findings, we propose: (1) Case 1.
Specifically, Δ s S t = t t-1 (t-1)! r (2)

Q(X) 5) Round until Convergence: Steps 2 through 4 are repeated over multiple communication rounds until the global model converges to a satisfactory performance level or until predefined stopping criteria are met.
These results validate DPSFL's architectural advantages: its sequential validation-noise pipeline isolates Byzantine detection from DP perturbations, ensuring precise gradient filtering before noise injection.
Typically, we set the threshold t as n/3 ≤ t ≤ n/2 to maintain system robustness even when some participants are dishonest.
These augmented shares are then transmitted to a central server.
put forth a novel BR strategy that combine normbased detection with accuracy-based detection.
We highlight our contributions as follows:
r A novel FL architecture with intermediary secondary servers that decouple Byzantine resilience from differential privacy.
We adopt and revise the approach of Biswas et al.
This aligns with the hypothesis that DP noise disrupts the stealthy gradient patterns required for persistent backdoor embedding, whereas EIFFeL's non differential privacy design remains vulnerable to such latent perturbations.
Setup(|S|, λ) → (p, q, g, h, t), and generates two empty sets S M , U M to store the malicious party.
First, the oracle O OR confirms that c s,j indeed commits to the secret b s,j , which must be either 0 or 1.
Currently, numerous privacy-preserving mechanisms are employed to counter privacy leakage in FL, which can be broadly categorized into cryptographic primitives , , and DP techniques , ,.
A pivotal aspect of our analysis entails comparing x with x to quantify the magnitude of noise amplification, thereby elucidating how the introduced noise propagates through the reconstruction process..
