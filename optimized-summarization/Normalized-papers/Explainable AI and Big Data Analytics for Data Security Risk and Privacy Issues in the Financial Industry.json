The XAI tools can enhance the capabilities for raising alerts, but currently, they are focused only on tricky cases. If the malware is obvious in the system the existing XAI tools can handle it very quickly and easily but these need human experts who trust the XAI tools to figure out the malware. The reason human experts trust the XAI tool used is because they receive conflicting signals from the XAI tools that vary in the functions of these developed XAI tools. Automating the identification of potential cyber threats can be possible with the help of XAI tools, especially in the financial domain. Artificial intelligence and XAI tools have a very high capacity to help analysts spot and deal with suspicious events more than they currently do in the field of finance to find malware. It is very important to trust and understand AI models before using them in large systems. When the AI security techniques of the new XAI tools are used in realworld scenarios, several decision points must be considered to evaluate the new tool, including the use of the XAI tool analysis in real-time situations. Artificial Intelligence application models of cybersecurity operations is a burgeoning field, driven by the need to address inefficiencies and uncertainties while enhancing incident response performance. Cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and sophisticated, resulting in substantial losses of funds and system resources. The comparison study of introduction of an explainable AI (XAI) tool in real-world incident response teams to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of using a single AI model output before and after deploying the XAI tool shows a very high difference in influencing the analyst's result. Data collection to assess the effectiveness of the XAI tools is suitable for analyst interaction with alerts, including compliance with the AI model output before and after XAI is deployed in the analysis process. The best method to judge whether the XAI tool is reliable with the help of a survey . It is essential for the DARPA XAI progreamme to integrate AI perception with human cognitive processes, integrating philosophical inquiries and psychological research to identify common ground and critical variables in explanatory reasoning . This can be achieved by programming the computational XAI model based on how humans comprehend computations, providing the benefit that the XAI system will not consider human racial discrimination, colour or background providing the best genuine and secure result from the input variables . The imperative to enhance explainability in AI systems arises from the need for analysts to understand the functionality of XAI tools for trust and trust. In simple words, this concept is similar to the instance of the misclassification of an axe as an adze as both are different in functions but are similar tools and it is essential for the user to know the functionality of both tools for optimal performance. The Model A is Explainable Neural Network that combines the power of deep learning with interpretability. It uses a layered architecture where each neuron's decision-making process can be traced and explained. This model is particularly effective in identifying complex patterns in financial data while providing clear explanations for its predictions. . The Integration of cloud computing and AI has undeniably transformed the banking industry's field of data analytics.
