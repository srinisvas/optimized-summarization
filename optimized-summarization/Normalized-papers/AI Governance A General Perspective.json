      "content": "This paper addresses one of the most important and urgent topics of the present time, namely \"Governance of Artificial Intelligence\". If artificial intelligence is currently used in all fields and sectors such as healthcare, education, research, business, transportation, drones and other fields, these multiple uses raise many risks related to the possibility of infringing the right to privacy and protection of personal data, bias and discrimination, as well as risks related to unemployment, security, transparency, and regulatory and legislative gaps. In this paper, we discuss defining the concept of artificial intelligence governance and the parties responsible for achieving this governance. Then we study the initiatives of artificial intelligence governance at the international level, such as Shanghai Declaration on Global AI Governance, IMF Framework for AI Governance, UNESCO's AI Ethics Recommendation, The OECD AI Principles and the European AI Act. Through these initiatives, we have reached the most important principles of artificial intelligence governance such as Accountability,"

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "content": "In light of the development and technological revolution that the world is currently witnessing, artificial intelligence has become an advanced position, as it has acquired control over many fields and sectors in daily life . With a little study, it becomes clear that artificial intelligence appears in many daily images and applications. Examples of this include its role in social media platforms, Judicial system , education, scientific research , the business field, and health magazines , where it is used in detecting diseases, diagnosing them, and managing medical data . Artificial intelligence can also be used in the fields of agriculture, navigation, transportation, banking services, and many daily fields in which the use of artificial intelligence is mainly evident in appearance and tangible use. In addition to the above, artificial intelligence has created a scientific revolution that plays an important role in other fields such as ecommerce, transportation and communications .\nThere is no doubt that the increasing use of artificial intelligence in all daily activities and at the level of all sectors and fields may entail many risks that may affect the right to privacy and the protection of personal data. In addition to the possibility of inequality in some cases and a breach of some ethical values. In addition to the unemployment that may accompany the fields of artificial intelligence, it is necessary to establish frameworks and rules that ensure the governance of artificial intelligence so that its use in the aforementioned fields is consistent with the ethical frameworks and rules and within the framework of legal systems that guarantee the protection of privacy and personal data and nondiscrimination, transparency, integrity and other rules and foundations on which the idea of governance is based. Therefore, talking about the AI governance requires establishing a legal framework through which we ensure that the uses of artificial intelligence are within the ethical and legal frameworks, justice, equality, transparency, integrity and impartiality. In this regard, many initiatives have emerged at the international level, such as the Shanghai Declaration on Artificial Intelligence Governance, in addition to some efforts and initiatives at the regional level, such as those undertaken by the United Arab Emirates .\nIn addition to the above, the governance of artificial intelligence is not limited to the existence of legal and ethical frameworks, but also requires the development of human cadres that have an effective role in supervising artificial intelligence systems in order to ensure the achievement of this governance."

      "content": "Despite the many positives of artificial intelligence applications, their use is still undoubtedly fraught with risks and raises many problems that affect the basic rights of individuals and entail many legal consequences. With the recent increase in the use of artificial intelligence applications, the chances of invading on individuals' privacy have increased and new forms of violating the privacy of their data and infringing on their right to image and other elements of the right to privacy have emerged . It has become common that the use of artificial intelligence applications to access, for example, the goods and services provided are conditional on the user providing personal information about himself, such that he will not be able to access and use these applications without providing this data , and that when the user declares his consent to the terms of the so-called privacy policy of these sites or applications, this is often done without reading the terms of these policies, and one of the terms of these policies may include the possibility of using this user's personal data by a third party in pursuit of certain commercial or advertising purposes that may have an impact on the lives of users .\nIn addition to the above, many applications include obtaining a person's photos and biometric characteristics and sharing them with different parties, which may constitute an infringement on the right to image and physical privacy, in addition to what tracking applications and cookies represent in terms of monitoring. The user's browsing of websites and creating a file on his interests and desires without his permission . It should also be noted that geolocation applications allow the user's location to be determined at any moment, and all of the above represents risks that fundamentally affect the right to privacy and personal data of users.\nFinally, many countries have resorted in recent years to using smart surveillance cameras that record videos and analyze all photos and video clips taken of individuals. While this may contribute to reducing crimes and violations and apprehending violence, it may constitute an infringement on individuals' privacy, in addition to the fact that the use of smart drones in surveillance work and flying taxis may infringe on the right to privacy for individuals ."

      "content": "Some writers have raised the issue of AI bias against certain groups based on the information stored, as recent developments in generative AI and its growing applications continue to raise serious human rights concerns , including concerns about racial discrimination and the infringement of minority rights .\nA prominent example of the potential for AI bias is racial biases brought about by technological advances in \"predictive policing,\" which can make assessments that predict who is likely to commit future crimes and where they will occur based on their geolocation and personal data, and which could exacerbate the long-standing practice of police targeting specific neighborhoods based on racial considerations for policing purposes. Police then focus on these neighborhoods, and individuals living there become registered on police records. This in turn affects where algorithms predict future crime will occur, leading to increased police presence in those areas."

There should be monitoring of the negative effects that the expansion in the use of artificial intelligence applications can cause, represented by crowding out workers in their jobs and those applications taking over many job opportunities, which could lead to more unemployment. Studies indicate that many manual and routine human workers will be dispensed with as a result of relying on applications of artificial intelligence systems instead of Human beings, which causes an increase in the scope of unemployment as a result of reducing job opportunities by 50% ."

Therefore, AI systems must be built with a high degree of clarity and explainability, with features to track the stages of automated decision-making, especially those that may lead to harmful effects on individuals. This means that, the data, algorithms, capabilities, processes and purpose of an AI system all need to be transparent and explainable to those directly and indirectly affected by it . The degree to which a system is traceable, auditable, transparent and explainable depends on the context of the AI system, its purpose and the results it may produce. AI systems and their developers are able to justify the foundations of their design, practices, operations, algorithms, decisions, and behaviors that are ethically permissible and not harmful to the public.\nThe principle of accountability and responsibility holds designers, developers, administrators and evaluators of AI systems morally responsible for decisions and actions that may lead to potential risks and negative impacts on individuals and societies . Human oversight, governance and appropriate management must be applied throughout the entire life cycle of an AI system to ensure the existence of Appropriate mechanisms to avoid harm and misuse of this technology. AI systems should not deceive people or unjustifiably harm their freedom of choice. Designers, developers and people implementing the AI system should be identified and accessible to stakeholders . Responsible parties should take the necessary preventive measures and put in place risk assessment and mitigation strategy to limit the harm caused by the AI system. The parties responsible for the AI system must ensure that the system's fairness and sustainability are maintained through oversight mechanisms. All parties involved in the AI system's life cycle must take these principles into account when making decisions."

However, these rapid changes naturally raise serious ethical concerns, stemming from the potential of AI systems to inculcate bias, exacerbate climate degradation, threaten human rights, and much more. The risks posed by AI are already compounding existing inequalities, further harming already marginalized groups.\nAmong the recent uses of AI technologies are self-driving cars and their futuristic design and cabin features, as well as drones.

Operating these smart systems requires the same amount of energy as 126 Danish homes consume in a whole year, and emits an amount of \"carbon dioxide\" equivalent to the emissions from driving 700,000 kilometers, according to an IT expert .\nTherefore, these systems have \"negative repercussions\" on energy consumption, and cause \"an increase in greenhouse gas emissions,\" which means an increase in \"global pollution\" rates. The more \"modern technological devices\" are used, the higher the levels of greenhouse gases that cause \"global warming,\" leading to \"serious climate changes.\"\nStudies indicate that \"artificial intelligence\" is entering several fields and thus consumes more than 5 percent of electricity production worldwide, which affects \"increased global warming and carbon emissions . Artificial intelligence may cause pollution rates to \"multiply\" by rates 5 to 7 times higher than the current situation, which threatens the safety of living organisms. While the world is looking to \"reduce environmental pollution\", artificial intelligence can \"make the situation worse\", in light of the growing trend of reliance on these smart systems in many fields. If \"artificial intelligence systems\" develop in an \"uncontrolled\" manner in the future, this will have \"catastrophic consequences\" for the planet.

In these cases, the potential consequences of biased or inaccurate AI outputs are much more severe . People could lose their life savings, career opportunities, or years of their lives. That's why it's so important for human oversight of AI applications and decisions. For stakeholders to trust that AI is making effective and fair decisions on their behalf, they need a clear view of how the models work, the logic of the algorithms, and how the model is evaluated for accuracy and fairness. They also need to know more about the data used to train and tune the model, including where the data comes from and how the data is processed, weighted, and classified. In short, AI systems should not cause, accelerate, or negatively impact humans, but should enable and complement technological, social, and environmental progress while seeking to address the associated challenges."

      "content": "It has become clear that although artificial intelligence offers humanity enormous potential for use in all fields, it entails significant risks, especially infringement of the right to privacy, discrimination, and harm to marginalized groups or minorities, especially since not all countries have the same technological capabilities and a small number of companies control artificial intelligence systems. All of this requires the development of frameworks for the governance of artificial intelligence, including the basic principles that must be relied upon in its uses. However, the development of these frameworks requires cooperation at all levels. Therefore, we recommend holding an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations and with the attendance of the world's largest technology companies to develop rules and frameworks for the governance of artificial intelligence. In this regard, we appreciate what the European Union has done by enacting or enacting legislation regulating artificial intelligence at the level of the European Union countries.\nFinally, this paper paves the way for other researchers to conduct further studies, whether related to the idea of AI governance frameworks in general, or to a specialized and indepth study of one of these frameworks such as privacy protection, transparency, or others. It also opens the way for other studies related to the challenges facing the development of AI governance frameworks, foremost of which is the rapid technological progress, and the extent to which these frameworks can be modified, changed, and developed to keep pace with these technological developments."
