      "content": "The above quoted statement was generated by an artificial intelligence algorithm (that uses natural learning processing and was trained on medical ethics) while consulting about its ethical considerations regarding using extended reality (XR) technology for medical purposes.\nXR is the next generation of digital computing blending the digital and physical worlds together enabling enduser interaction with intelligent objects powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies . XR encompasses all technologies within the virtuality continuum including Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality (MR) and everything else that may exist within the continuum . The concept of \"Virtuality Continuum\" and the term Mixed Reality (MR) was first described by Milgram and Kishino in 1994 . Milgram and Kishino described MR as completely connected physical and virtual environments presented within a display which the researchers termed as the virtuality continuum (VC) concept. Microsoft has since revised the VC concept and proposed their own. MR hardware technology extends past Milgram and Kishino original vision of the technology as spatial sound, environmental input including spatial understanding and positional location of the user (X, Y, and Z spatial coordinates) are incorporated in immersive hardware devices . People interact with virtual objects in a MR environment using a combination of gaze, gestures and voice commands and are guided by spatial sound and spatial/ environmental understanding of digital objects overlaid within one's physical environment. Microsoft updated their MR definition to encompass both the physical and digital worlds across the MR spectrum including AR and VR. Stanley G. Weinbaum described in 1935 a fictional model that questions reality for \"magic spectacles\" that exist as goggles that project a story, sight, sound, smell, and taste for the wearer of the device. He went on to describe that \"You are in the story, you speak to the shadows (characters), and they reply, and instead of being on a screen, the story is all about you, and you are in it\" . Antonin Artaud was a French dramatist who may have been the first to define and label the term VR in his book published in 1938 . He related theatre as being a virtual reality, \"la réalité virtuelle\", as characters, objects, and images \"take on the phantasmagoric force of alchemy's visionary internal dramas\" . VR hardware had an early version in 1838 when the first stereoscope that projected a single image by two mirrors was invented. Eventually the stereoscope evolved into the View-Master and was patented in 1938 and \"We can't stop technological progress and so we have to be prepared for the consequences.\" -Nurenyx.AI is available today . The term AR was first introduced by two employees at Boeing Computer Services Research named Tom Caudell and David Mizell in 1990 . They successfully implemented the usage of AR within an industrial setting for wiring instructions for new aircraft being built. Workers would wear head-mounted displays to see overlaid cable positions projected through the eyewear. XR devices available today are powered by AI and ML algorithms, collects biometric data, can integrate Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) technology, can connect cross-platform across any device including traditional mobile phones, desktops, tablets, and laptops. Healthcare is one of the top industries that is adopting XR technology.\nOrganizations must be proactive with following an ethical framework to leverage this powerful XR technology that is here to stay. The global COVID-2019 pandemic has accelerated the adoption rate of XR technology by enterprise corporations and now is the time to be as proactive as possible to develop effective ethical policies for companies and developers to adhere to while designing applications that leverage XR."

      "content": "High quality three-dimensional visualization of heart anatomy in XR is the most utilized and one of the simplest medical applications that is used for educational/training as well as pre-operative planning. Numerous XR-based medical applications have been developed as patient education and pre-operative procedure simulation of cardiology procedures. However, several medical devices/applications are utilizing XR to support and help patients and healthcare providers in various disease management and treatment procedures. In a pilot trial, researchers showed that task-specific VR training provides significant added benefit to patients recovering from chronic stroke . Based on these findings, Mindmaze developed MindMotionPRO and MindMotion Go, two medical-grade XR tools designed specifically to support and promote active and rigorous rehabilitation. In addition, clinicians and researchers are using standalone tools like The Body VR to 3D construct radiologic imaging data (from CT, MRI and PET scans) during pre-procedural planning of patients with cardiovascular diseases . Healthcare providers are increasingly adopting XR-based tools (e.g., EchoPixel) to perform virtual run-throughs of routine and complex procedures to better prepare for the actual procedure . In cardiology, XR applications are constantly being developed and tested for intraprocedural use-cases , . One major limitation of these newly developed tools is the lack of thorough validation. As XR medical applications mature and evolve, much needed validation of their use-case and feasibility in current healthcare settings will be available in near future.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Kennesaw State University.

      "content": "Similarly in neuroscience, XR is extensively explored and tested by researchers as it holds high potential for its ability in providing behavioral modifications. Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is gaining a lot of attention and support for treating specific phobias. In VRET, patients are exposed to a virtual/simulated environment resembling their real-life fear or phobias. In a large meta-analysis, which included 14 clinical trial studies, patients who received VRET showed a significant behavioral change and were better able to handle their fears compared to patients who did not receive VRET . In addition, XR-based platforms are increasingly being used for neuropsychological assessments as well as assessing efficacy and/or response from ongoing therapies such as for cancer . For patients suffering from neurological disorders, clinicians are integrating real-time information from biosensors, clinical data, radiological images, and stimulation data into XR to get a more comprehensive view of the patient condition and the process . Although XR provides great technological breakthroughs in treating neurologic diseases, there are several concerns/limitations associated with them. Due to the high use of simulations and virtual environments, users develop cybersickness in which they experience motion sickness, eye strain, fatigue, headache, and nausea . In some cases, patients using XR medical application develop symptoms related to dissociative disorders ."

There are other applications in the development that show various useful areas where XR can make an impact. XR has potential to revolutionize patient self-care by motivating healthier lifestyle choices. For instance, an increasing number of pharmacists are now helping patients quit smoking through virtual reality mindful exposure therapy (VR-MET). The VR-MET approach is based on the published research where patients learn and cope with their cravings through virtually simulated environment . Similar XR applications are also being developed to help patients identify and avoid alcohol misuse .\nSome additional XR pharmacy applications include reducing anxiety due to trypanophobia experienced during blood draws, and immunizations in both adults and children. Like other applications, XR use for pharmacy applications have not been fully tested and validated and is further being developed for more generalized and broader use."

      "title": "AWS, POLICIES, AND PRINCIPLES THAT APPLY TO MEDICAL EXTENDED REALITY",
      "content": "Extended reality technologies are becoming more and more affordable and accessible as time progresses.\nMultiple manufacturers have entered the market with affordable hardware, accelerating the research and development efforts by researchers, innovators, and healthcare providers. Several medical use-cases such as pain management, rehabilitation, and phobia treatment for XR have been proposed, many of them in later stages of development. Though XR brings advantages and improved medical tools to our healthcare systems, recently discovered health concerns that are associated with its use need to be addressed. Patients who used XR for medical purposes, experienced cyber sickness and/or developed symptoms related to dissociative disorders . In rare cases, patients suffering from psychosis experienced a psychiatric episode triggered from the extended use of XR . The safety and effectiveness of XR medical applications should be thoroughly tested in a typical clinical trial setting. There is a lack of regulatory gap in the field of XR, and therefore one should be very cautious about using or prescribing XR-based tools/applications until they are rigorously tested and approved by a federal health agency . Current laws and policies in place for internet of medical devices or other digital tools or drugs can be extended to XR. In this paper, some of the important guidelines or laws that need to be considered before using XR for medical purposes are discussed.\nFrom the recent implementation of telemedicine in current health practice, there are few direct things that need to be considered from legal and regulatory issues. In a recent meta-analysis, researchers reviewed 68 published works from literature to evaluate legal, ethical, and regulatory concerns raised by other researchers and clinician scientists . Concerns involving consent, confidentiality, privacy, the doctor-patient relationship, data security, responsibility, record keeping, licensure, continuity of care, quality of care, image quality, concordance, phone stewardship and patient satisfaction were identified in this extensive review of proposed guidelines .\nThere is little to no proposed framework to tackle these issues available in literature and many of these concerns are currently being addressed by FDA in the form of clinical guidelines .\nFreedom of thought and mental integrity is one of the most important ethical issue for XR as these emerging technologies can exert behavioral modifications and change patients attitudes through persuasion. In other words, XR tends to change what the user is thinking of or his/her own beliefs. Therefore, the use and even sale of XR applications and associated hardware should be strictly regulated like other medical devices. The authenticity of information delivered over XR is another potential concern. It is the healthcare professional's duty to inform patients with correct information regarding the disease condition, available diagnostic/therapeutic options, and any side-effects or symptoms from a prescribed treatment or a drug. This holds true for XR medical applications, and it should be the healthcare professional's responsibility to provide this information to patients. Also, Medical XR applications should only be prescribed to patients by a licensed healthcare practitioner. This paper does not take a stand on how freedom of thought is defined, but merely states the potentially dangerous implications of XR technology if used in a corrupt way.\nInstead of devising new guidelines for XR-based healthcare tools, the guidelines that were originally proposed for telemedicine are also relevant to XR and therefore their practice should be extended to XR. Specifically, guidelines proposed by American College of Physicians and American Medical Association address the majority of the previously listed concerns regarding XR and therefore should be extended to XR medical applications , . These guidelines form a good basis for practicing the use of XR-based tools; however, they may not address all known and future concerns and therefore should be routinely updated and revised."

      "title": "EY ETHICAL PRINCIPLES FOR USE OF MEDICAL EXTENDED REALITY",
      "content": "Advances in computing and displays have enabled a recent surge in low-cost, mixed-reality devices, including AR and VR, which have resulted in substantial interest in the development of medical extended reality (MXR) devices. Clinical researchers and medical device developers have started to make use of this technology for critical surgery, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Despite all the previous mentioned, the evaluation of MXR devices has been significantly delayed, causing inefficiency, and increased regulatory burden in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of MXR applications and in identifying acceptable claims due to the pace of the development.\nFor all the above reasons, it is of high priority to consider the urgent unanswered ethical questions regarding user data practices including collection, management, and exploitation within these ecosystems, given that the integrated sensory enhancements (and embedded or implanted devices) can become dangerous. All in all, a great advantage of VR is that this type of \"reality\" can be controlled, so patients learn to deal with challenges in a stepwise manner . Meanwhile, the use of VR in clinical research and treatment creates new forms of human-technology interaction in medicine with substantial ethical tensions , particularly regarding vulnerable patients. Doubtlessly, emerging virtual reality systems offer intriguing therapeutic possibilities, but their development and use should be guided by ethical priorities that account for the specific vulnerabilities of patients , including the core bioethical principles of respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice."

To be more specific, the following three areas of opportunity for AR/VR play a significant role in supporting broader equity and inclusion efforts: 1) leveraging its potential as an empathy tool and adapting its extensive capabilities to meet the needs of users with disabilities, 2) mitigating barriers that arise from physical distance to strengthen communities, and 3) enhancing person-to-person interactions across locations .\nAR/VR-immersive technologies that enable users to experience digitally rendered content in both physical and virtual space-have the potential to transform the way individuals work, learn, and interact . By mitigating barriers imposed by physical distance, they can bolster economic opportunity by allowing employees to collaborate from anywhere in the world, make critical services such as healthcare more accessible, creating new channels for social connections, and finally their ability to manipulate elements of partially or fully virtual spaces allow them to more easily accommodate a diverse set of user needs, from accessibility features to privacy preferences .\nAll in all, immersive technologies have the potential on the one hand to make both digital and non-digital services and spaces more inclusive and equitable; whereas, on the on other hand, industry leaders and policymakers will come up with great challenges to maximize the availability of immersive technologies across a wide range of demographics and to mitigate potential unintended consequences. Particularly, they should take into serious consideration the following:\nPrivacy, health, and safety risks that could adversely affect AR/VR users and non-users.\nFinancial, physical, technical, and societal barriers different user groups face when adopting or using AR/VR devices and applications.\nBias and discrimination risks in critical areas such as healthcare services .\nFocus on the previous considerations will benefit many users by reducing the potential for malicious use of the technology or other unintended consequences that could impede progress in AR/VR adoption ."

      "content": "To address challenges, those in charge of designing and implementing the technology will need to delve into the perspectives and lived experiences of a diverse array of individuals. If they hope to ensure AR/VR advances inclusiveness and equity, they should pay attention to voices from vulnerable, marginalized, or otherwise underserved individuals and underrepresented communities in discussions around both policy and product development .\nIterative design is a key principle of HCI (human-computer interaction), wherein usability considerations are incorporated from the start of the design process, meaning that systems are periodically tested with users as part of the development process, resulting in iterative improvements to the design and usability until the system is ready to deploy to end-users . Unfortunately, in practice, fixes for usability concerns perceived as affecting small populations (such as people with disabilities) are often tacked on at the end of the software design lifecycle, resulting in sub-par user experiences . However, considering accessibility as a core part of a system's iterative design process is valuable for all users, since everyone experiences situational disabilities dependent on their context (e.g., a person holding groceries is unable to use their arms for other tasks, a person in a loud room may have difficulty hearing.) .\nVirtual Reality (VR) technologies are at a key crossroads in their development, with costs and form-factors placing them just at the cusp of widespread commercial feasibility, hence accessibility has not thus far been a consideration in the development of mainstream VR systems . However, the following five key areas of accessibility for the VR community needs to be considered: the accessibility of VR content, the accessibility of interaction techniques, device/hardware accessibility, inclusive user representations within VR environments, and accessibility-focused application areas for VR . The VR community should seize this moment in time (while devices and standards are still evolving) to include accessibility considerations in VR systems that will create a more usable and inclusive technological future for users of all abilities ."

A valid IC requires the patient's full understanding of the proposed intervention, including potential risks, benefits, and alternatives . The patient's decision must be independent, free-willed, and considered valid solely once the therapeutic procedure (along with all the possible management alternatives), the expected benefits, and the possible risks have been comprehended. Currently, the information disclosed is often either too superficial or filled with overwhelming technical information, making it arduous for patients to truly take in , .\nCommunication skills are pivotal to this process. The use of traditional paper-based consent forms may generate difficulties for doctors to express themselves appropriately, as they limit the dialogue to the mere reading of the document. New technologies may improve the delivery of health information by providing a more informal environment in which the patient can see the case in a three-dimensional (3D) reality and have the chance to ask and discuss these images with the doctor who may feel more at ease and comfortable in answering all questions and thoroughly explaining the case ."

The process requires external review: institutional review boards and ethics of research committees will necessarily become familiar with the potential hazards of VR experiences and be able to reach an informed view on the potential risks to vulnerable patients of the VR experience . This practically means that patients who are mentally impaired and/or physically disabled are not capable of making an informed decision about virtual reality environments and based on their curiosity and excitement on the technology, this may further obscure their judgment.\nIn advance, medical centers, where the creation of virtual reality environments is necessary, must respond to the challenge of the technology. Before patients are exposed to VR environments, those centers should establish standards of \"clinical safety\" , because there is the possibility that VR systems may unintentionally introduce errors or distortions, due to programming errors, causing mental distress to a patient. In case of dependent patients whose quality of life is much reduced by chronic illness or disability, the VR environment may be preferable than reality.\nWhat is more, introducing patients to VR environments raises fundamental ethical issues concerning free will, the nature of interpersonal relationships, and how the consequences of our interpersonal behavior is understood . What are the consequences for the individual itself in case the VR environment is populated by simulated characters drawn from real life-sketches with no free will and predetermined behavior?

      "title": "UILDING AN ETHICAL APPROACH FOR MEDICAL EXTENDED REALITY",
      "content": "XR technology is beneficial to society. Not only does it help economic growth by improving medical care and using XR for various training purposes, but it can also be used to improve or enhance certain lives. On one hand, medical professionals can use XR technology to improve the care they give their patients by simulating certain conditions and developing a better understanding of how to treat those conditions. XR technology can also be used to train and educate medical professionals so that they can provide better care than ever before. This applies not only to the education process but also as a way of improving doctor-patient interactions. XR allows a person to experience things that would otherwise be impossible. It's not hard to imagine how XR technology could augment existing medical procedures for more patient comfort or even allow doctors to perform surgery remotely via telepresence robot. XR is a highly immersive experience that can be used to manipulate people's senses, thoughts, and emotions. What makes XR appealing is the possibility to interact with a seemingly realistic world, and this raises moral questions regarding its use. Is it okay for doctors to practice surgery in XR? Should people suffering from chronic pain be permitted to experience pleasant sensations via XR?\nIt seems like XR is here to stay. It can't be predicted how it will change human civilization, but it seems almost certain that the world will never be quite the same. Let's first look at the related concepts of ethics and grounded theory. The purpose of medical ethics is to provide a framework for making ethical decisions in medicine. That is, some sort of an approach is needed that can help humans make moral judgments regarding right and wrong actions, and it should be based on the philosophical considerations that lie behind medical practice. Ethics is an applied branch of philosophy that analyzes the practice of clinical medicine and related scientific research.\nMedical ethics can be considered as a system of moral principles that guides decisions regarding right or wrong conduct in medical institutions, engineering practices, research methodologies, among other fields. Grounded theory is a type of inductive analysis made famous by the work of Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss in 1967 . It was designed to generate an understanding of human activities, especially during the process of social interaction. The method is rooted within qualitative research. In grounded theory, one starts with the observation of a phenomenon and makes connections between events based on data from real-life situations.\nIn fact, grounded theory is considered an inductive method, in contrast with deductive methods such as logical positivism. Now, let's look at the concept of \"ethics\" and its application in medicine. Medical ethics is based on a set of values that professionals can refer to when making decisions in any case where there might be confusion or conflict about how one should act. The core principle of medical ethics is the respect for human autonomy .\nAutonomy refers to a person's ability to make decisions or choices that affect life without interference from others."

      "content": "Recent advances in software and hardware supporting XR led to the development of numerous medical applications where XR-based tools and services are making a significant impact in improving patient lives and disease management. Thus, XR technologies are benefiting patients, healthcare providers and researchers, making them more robust, convenient, and attractive tools for healthcare. Cardiovascular, neuroscience, pharmacy, telehealth, and surgical procedures are the biggest fields where XR is integrated for providing smoother, reliable, and more efficient medical care. In this paper, some of the recent advancements and highlights in XR development have been reviewed, and there are many other disciplines of healthcare where XR technologies are making a significant impact. Although the majority of the Medical XR applications are still under development, many of them need further validation before making them available for general use. Recently XRrelated health concerns such as cybersickness have been reported in patients who are using XR applications. The following issues need to be addressed as well as patient privacy and its ethical use should be addressed immediately.\n Misuse and/or abuse of personal data  Unregulated XR may lead to unfavorable outcomes  XR is embedded into companies' decision making, processes, and products  Algorithms change and adapt over time.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Kennesaw State University.
