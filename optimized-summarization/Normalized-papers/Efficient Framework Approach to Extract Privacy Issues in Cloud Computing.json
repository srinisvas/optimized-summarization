      "title": "Abstract",
      "content": "To overcome the challenges emerged in adoption of cloud computing technologies, many countries has conceived and designed data privacy and confidentiality protection regulations. The objective of this paper is to identify privacy issues and design a framework pertaining to privacy and confidentiality concerns in adopting cloud computing. It is imperative to note that privacy concern is increasingly important in the online world. The secure processing of personal data in the cloud is a huge challenge now a days. Such a framework and exploration can provide benefits to the all communities linked with cloud computing. It will help in better understanding of the privacy issues associated with cloud and will spark ideas and lead to further research on this subject whom may lead to the development of privacy regulations and/or the improvement of existing Regulations."

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "content": "Cloud Computing is comparatively a new model in the IT world. It has-been defined by NIST, as the following: \"Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction\". Cloud computing has four deployment models. Those are: 1) Public Cloud: In public cloud infrastructure is made available to general public and is owned and managed by CSP.\nPrivate Cloud: In Private cloud, infrastructure is used by a single organization.\nCommunity Cloud: In community cloud service the cloud infrastructure is used by several organizations belongs to specific community that has shared concerns. 4) Hybrid Cloud: In Hybrid cloud, cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public).\nCloud computing has essentially five main characteristics shown in the diagram: Privacy is a key issue in cloud computing. In general, privacy is about the accountability of a cloud provider to customer, as well as the transparency to cloud provider's practice around personal data/information. Cloud computing is a rising technology in the field of Information Technology. Therefore, it is of preeminent importance to deal with issues and challenges of privacy. Offending and violation of privacy not only affects users but also cloud service provider because it maculates their credibility with customers. The concept of privacy varies widely among countries and jurisdictions."

      "title": "MAJOR PRIVACY CONCERNS",
      "content": "In the present time the way of managing the data on cloud has been changed. The customers have lost their control over the data and depend on the cloud service provider. This change leads to a number of privacy concerns to be raised. Some of the privacy concerns had been discussed here and these are as follows:\nCompliance: It indicates the list of applicable laws, regulations, standards and contractual commitments that govern cloud computing data. The privacy laws for different jurisdiction may vary so it is required what is the relevant jurisdiction that governs data in the cloud computing."

      "content": "As technology is changing day by day the laws should also be updated so that it can provide full fledge security. The cloud provider should establish transparent policies to customer so that customers can easily understand them.\nAll of the above are major concerns which have to be taken into the consideration for the development of the framework in cloud computing."

Those frameworks are: a) \"U.S-EU Safe Harbor\" is a framework that developed in order to cover up the differences in approach of privacy that is taken by U.S and that has taken by the EU, when data is being transferred from the EU to U.S. \"U.S-Swiss Safe Harbor\" is a framework to bridge the differences in privacy approaches between the U.S and Switzerland. Many cloud providers comply with this framework, ex: Google, Amazon, HP etc. b) \"NSTIC2 Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs)\": It is a widely accepted framework and is followed by many U.S states , as well as many foreign nations and international Privacy Framework ."

In future we are considering that we will be able to make new frameworks by combining the perspectives of all the above covered frameworks and will be able to serve as a better cloud service provider. The concept of transparency will be prior for those frameworks which have been made with user's perspective point of view and level of privacy will depends upon the level of transparency."
