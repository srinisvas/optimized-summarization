      "content": "Rapid advancements in AI and blockchain-based digital health platforms have led to the development of several privacy, security, and moral solutions. These are crucial for reliable and efficient systems . Federated learning, a crucial tool for privacy-protecting machine learning, enables the training of models across various data sources without centralization. It keeps private data near to its source, reducing privacy risk. Federated learning keeps information private and follows the rules, but communication costs and the requirement for robust models that can swiftly aggregate changes in multiple areas limit its growth . While independence simplifies the system's operation, it delays model synchronization. Homomorphic encryption allows you to calculate protected data while keeping it private. This strategy works effectively to protect data from unauthorized viewing while processing. The complexity of the coding process contributes to its slowness and energy waste. Homomorphic encryption necessitates significant computer power, rendering it unsuitable for large-scale implementation in digital health centers that prioritize speedy work. Differential privacy protects privacy . It hides individuals by adding random noise to the data. It establishes a statistical technique to shield data from personal identification. Differential privacy protects privacy effectively, but it's not as secure as other approaches and may not maintain data accuracy in large This beneficial strategy boasts welldocumented legal compliance. strategy. This makes it ideal for privacy-protecting digital health apps . Another intriguing option is zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). They allow one side to prove a point without proving the facts. Verified trades or information transfers protect private information. ZKPs offer exceptional security, but the challenge of computing the proof limits their widespread use. They may not operate well together in blockchain applications, and adding them to realworld systems may be difficult .Quantum computing poses hazards to digital health systems; thus, post-quantum cryptography protects them. Quantum computers might break conventional encryption technologies; therefore, our solution protects encrypted protocols. Although post-quantum cryptography is secure, it faces challenges with scale and latency due to the complexity of the cryptographic algorithms used, which may not be suitable for widespread use . Multi-signature authentication makes transactions safer by requiring several participants. Bad actors find it tougher to exploit the system. This proposal protects digital health system safety, notably blockchain-based applications, but it may reduce their usefulness due to many evaluations. Collecting a large number of documents can make energy conservation challenging. Making AI-based decision-making tools transparent and accountable requires explicable AI (XAI). It helps everyone understand and evaluate AI conclusions, which is crucial in healthcare where options must be clear and rational. By exposing how the model generates judgments, XAI eliminates weaknesses and makes things fairer. Explainable models may slow down massive system growth, particularly when dealing with tough data. Smart contract verification ensures smart contract-based blockchain applications are secure and accurate . These automated contracts play a crucial role in controlling autonomous systems, but their failure or weakness could potentially be costly or immoral. Regularly monitoring smart contracts may reduce these dangers, but it requires technical expertise and attention. Self-sovereign identification (SSI) solutions let people own their data."

      "content": "In AI-driven healthcare systems, ethical considerations are increasingly crucial since medical decisions are intricate and affect patient outcomes. The recommended strategy addresses healthcare AI ethical challenges by organizing and methodically examining AI model choices. Bias, fairness, and transparency underpin this strategy. It describes how to analyze and improve healthcare choices while respecting moral norms. Look at the moral danger of AI systems making choices first. Several unethical practices affect healthcare AI model fairness and reliability. This review focused on prejudice, truth, and openness.

Figure 1 depicts the Ethical Risk Scoring Algorithm. It examines AI and blockchain-based digital health system ethics. First, gather data and establish moral criteria like fairness, prejudice, and transparency. We examine each piece of data and assess the ethical risk. We adjust the component weights while keeping the risk number constant. We compare the ultimate score to the criteria to determine if we should highlight the choice. We alter the decision framework to consider ethics if necessary. Finally, either accepting or reviewing the option is the next step. The algorithm effectively operates in high-stakes, variable scenarios such as AI and blockchain-driven digital health systems, as it computes each step using intricate mathematical models that take into account the ethical risk score and situation sensitivity.\n•Final Output: Accept or flag decision.\n•Update Framework: Adjust decision rules if necessary.\n•Evaluate Decision: Flag decision if score exceeds threshold.\n•Threshold Comparison: Compare risk score to threshold.\n•Final Ethical Risk Score: Compute final risk score.\n•Adjust Weights: Modify weighting factors as needed.\n•Normalize Scores: Scale ethical risk score.\n•Calculate Ethical Risk: Combine bias, fairness, and transparency scores.\n•Assess Transparency: Calculate transparency score.\n•Assess Fairness: Calculate fairness score.\n•Assess Bias: Calculate bias score.\n•Initialize Factors: Set initial values for bias, fairness, and transparency.\n•Input Data: Collect data and decision rules. Figure 2 demonstrates AI-and blockchain-based social problem decision-making in digital health contexts. Enter ethical risk ratings and case information. The application calculates the risk and compares it to a limit. If the danger surpasses the threshold, the application employs morally sound modification factors. We review revised risks to determine if they require disclosure. We issue warnings if the decision surpasses the flagging threshold. If not, accept. The last step is to accept or reject the decision using the updated risk number. The flowchart promotes obedience and excellent judgment. It starts by figuring out the compliance number and matching it to certain standards. If the score doesn't meet the standards, the program uses bias adjustment to figure out the risk of the choice again. After that, it goes through more confirmation tests to make sure it is fair and follows ethical rules . If any of these conditions are not satisfied, we mark the choice for further review. In that scenario, we accept the choice and conclude the process. This step makes sure that the decisions made in AI-and blockchain-powered digital health systems are ethical, fair, and don't show bias. This results in trustworthy and responsible outcomes.\nIV. RESULT AI-and blockchain-driven digital health settings and procedures tested against privacy, ethical, and security concerns indicate substantial positives and downsides. These systems must protect private health information, be transparent about choices, make the system secure, obey the regulations, and prioritize justice and progress. To determine the best digital health app approach, assess their performance across several factors. Each technique has merits and downsides. A radar map in Figure 5 compares AI and blockchain technologies for security and system characteristics, such as how well they function together, how safe the data is, who can access it, how large the system can become, and how effectively it can recover from catastrophes. The top choice scored virtually perfect (95) for stability and scale, proving it can manage complex and evolving digital health circumstances. Homomorphic encryption and blockchain interface protocols are safer, but they struggle to scale and recover from catastrophes. Some measurements are more effective for explainable AI than others, and they encounter challenges when integrating with other systems. This graph indicates how effectively the recommended strategy works overall, ensuring a secure, scalable, and robust system for emerging digital health challenges."
