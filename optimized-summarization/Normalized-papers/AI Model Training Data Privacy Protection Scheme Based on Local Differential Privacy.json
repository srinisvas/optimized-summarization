      "content": "With the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in various industries, from healthcare to finance and smart grids, the importance of data privacy has become more pressing than ever. The ability of AI systems to analyze vast amounts of data allows for enhanced decisionmaking, optimized operations, and increased efficiency. However, this benefit comes with a significant costprivacy risks. AI models often rely on large datasets that may contain sensitive personal information such as medical records, financial transactions, or usage patterns in critical infrastructure like electricity grids. Protecting the privacy of this data is crucial, not only for legal compliance but also to maintain trust between users and AI systems.\nTraditional approaches to privacy protection, such as encryption and anonymization, have been widely used in various applications. Nevertheless, when applied to AI model training, these methods present significant limitations. Data anonymization, while useful in some contexts, often results in degraded model performance due to loss of valuable information. Additionally, anonymized datasets are susceptible to re-identification attacks, especially when combined with auxiliary data sources. On the other hand, encryption techniques like homomorphic encryption enable computations on encrypted data but are computationally expensive, making them impractical for large-scale AI systems where real-time data processing is critical. In distributed AI settings, such as federated learning , even though raw data is not shared, model updates (gradients) exchanged between devices can still leak sensitive information, exposing vulnerabilities in the system.\nAs AI systems become more integrated with real-time applications-such as smart grids, autonomous systems, and medical diagnostics-the need for privacy-preserving methods that can safeguard data without compromising model performance has grown. Existing solutions either place a heavy computational burden on the system or fall short in preventing privacy leakage, especially in decentralized or distributed environments. This creates a significant challenge for AI systems that require both high efficiency and robust privacy protections. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a solution based on local differential privacy (LDP) for AI model training in distributed environments. Local differential privacy allows noise to be added directly to the data at the point of collection, ensuring that privacy is protected before the data is even transmitted. This method not only eliminates the need for centralized data aggregation but also reduces the risk of privacy breaches during data sharing. Additionally, this approach can be extended to protect model training by applying noise to the gradients during the learning process, thereby preventing adversaries from inferring sensitive information through model updates .\nBy leveraging LDP in both the data collection and model training phases, this method ensures a strong privacy guarantee while maintaining the utility of the AI models. This paper explores the practical application of local differential privacy in real-time AI systems, such as those deployed in smart grids, and evaluates its effectiveness in balancing privacy protection with model performance."

      "title": "Privacy-Preserving AI Model Training",
      "content": "Differential privacy has been a popular tool for protecting individual data in machine learning models. One of the most prominent works in this field is the differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), introduced by Abadi et al. (2016) , which applies noise to gradients during the training process to guarantee privacy. However, DP-SGD operates in a centralized setting where all the data is collected at a central server, making it unsuitable for scenarios involving distributed data fusion.\nHomomorphic encryption is another method used for privacy protection in AI, allowing computations on encrypted data. However, this approach is computationally expensive and can be impractical for real-time or largescale applications due to its high computational overhead.\nIn contrast, local differential privacy (LDP) offers a more practical approach for distributed data environments, as it allows users to add noise to their data locally before sharing it with a central server or participating in a distributed model training process. Geyer et al. ( 2017) explored LDP in the context of federated learning, providing privacy guarantees at the client level. Our work builds on these ideas, applying LDP to protect data in distributed data fusion environments ."

      "content": "Existing work on privacy in data fusion has mainly focused on secure multi-party computation (SMC) and homomorphic encryption, which enable data processing without exposing raw data. However, these techniques are computationally expensive and do not scale well to large, distributed datasets. To overcome these challenges, we introduce LDP-based data fusion for AI training, which can provide robust privacy protection while maintaining computational efficiency.\nDifferential privacy protection can overcome the limitations of traditional privacy protection techniques, such as reliance on attackers' background knowledge, the difficulty in quantitatively describing protection effectiveness with effective mathematical methods, etc. Thus, it can significantly reduce the risk of privacy leakage in protected datasets while maintaining the availability of dataset data as much as possible. The process involves adding random perturbations to real data and ensuring that the data remains usable after interference, aiming to distort protected data while simultaneously preserving specific data or data attributes in the dataset.\nThe implementation of differential privacy typically involves randomization or perturbation operations during data processing. The most common method is to add random noise during data queries or publication processes. By introducing an appropriate amount of randomness into the data, it becomes difficult for attackers to accurately infer the data contributions of specific individuals, thereby protecting individual privacy. Additionally, differential privacy involves the concept of privacy budget, which limits the extent of privacy information leakage, ensuring the protection of individual privacy while maintaining the validity and availability of data as much as possible during data analysis ."

      "title": "AI MODEL TRAINING DATA PRIVACY PROTECTION SCHEME BASED ON LOCAL DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY",
      "content": "In this section, we present the AI model training data privacy protection scheme based on Local Differential Privacy (LDP). The scheme is designed to protect the privacy of data in both data collection and training phases of AI models, especially in distributed environments where data is generated and processed across multiple devices. Our approach involves adding noise at two critical stages: directly at the data collection point to ensure privacy protection before transmission, and during the model training process to further safeguard privacy against adversarial attacks aimed at the learning process. The overall architecture of the algorithm is depicted in Figure 1. Below, we outline the key steps of the scheme. The primary objective of the scheme is to secure data privacy by integrating noise at various stages of the AI model training pipeline. The key components of the system include:\n(1) Noise generation and application at the data collection stage: before the data is transmitted or shared, local differential privacy is applied to each data point, ensuring that sensitive information is protected at the source.\n(2) Noise-enhanced gradient computation: during the model training process, noise is added to the gradients computed for model updates, which helps obscure the underlying data characteristics that could otherwise be inferred by analyzing the model's learning patterns.\n(3) Iterative model updates: the noisy gradients are used iteratively to update the model parameters, ensuring that the training process remains efficient while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.\nEach of these steps contributes to a comprehensive privacy protection mechanism that balances data security with the need for efficient and accurate model training. The following subsections would then elaborate on each of these steps."

      "title": "Data Preparation Phase",
      "content": "In the data preparation phase, the privacy budget and noise distribution parameters are chosen. Additionally, data undergoes preprocessing to ensure it aligns with the algorithm's requirements. The steps are as follows:\nStep 1 the privacy budget 𝜀 controls the strength of privacy protection. A smaller 𝜀 means stronger protection but can reduce the utility of the data. In this scheme, we introduce dynamic privacy budget adjustment during model training. Initially, the privacy budget is set to a conservative value 𝜀 0 . As model training progresses and the model's accuracy is evaluated, 𝜀 may be adjusted to balance privacy and utility. Dynamic adjustment of 𝜀 can be defined as:\n𝜀 𝑡 = 𝜀 0 • (1 + 𝛼 • 𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑦 )\nWhere 𝛼 is a tuning parameter and 𝑡 denotes the iteration step.\nStep 2 choosing the noise distribution: based on the principles of local differential privacy (LDP), we use the Laplace noise mechanism for perturbing data. The scale of the Laplace distribution 𝑏 is determined by the privacy budget 𝜀, calculated as: 𝑏 = Step 3 data preprocessing: before adding noise, the raw data must undergo preprocessing to ensure consistency and compatibility with the differential privacy algorithm. This involves standardization, where features are scaled to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\nAdditionally, missing values must be handled, either by imputing them or removing incomplete records. Finally, data format consistency must be ensured so that it aligns with the requirements of the differential privacy mechanism."

The noise generation follows the requirements of the local differential privacy mechanism to obscure sensitive information in user data. The generated noise is added to each individual user data point, resulting in an encrypted dataset. This ensures that data remains protected during transmission and storage, effectively preventing privacy breaches.\nStep 1: generate Laplace noise. based on the noise scale 𝑏 obtained in the previous steps, Laplace noise 𝑧 is generated. According to the probability density function of the noise, the noise value 𝑧 is added, where\n𝐿𝑎𝑝(𝑧|0，𝑏) = 1 2𝑏 exp (- |𝑧| 𝑏 ).\nStep 2: for each preprocessed data point 𝑥 𝑖 , Laplace noise 𝑧 𝑖 is added, with the formula 𝑥 𝑖 ′ = 𝑥 𝑖 + 𝑧 𝑖 .

      "title": "Dynamic Adjustment Phase",
      "content": "During the model training process, after multiple iterations of updating the model parameters, the performance evaluation stage is initiated. The primary goal of this stage is to assess the performance of the model, which has been processed with differential privacy, on the test or validation set. This ensures that the model can maintain a high level of accuracy and generalization capability while preserving data privacy. In this phase, the model's performance is evaluated, and the noise and privacy budget are adjusted accordingly.\nStep 1: evaluating model performance: after a set number of iterations, the model is evaluated on a separate validation set to measure accuracy and loss. This helps determine whether the current level of privacy and noise is appropriate.\nStep 2: adjusting privacy budget and noise: if the model's performance (e.g., accuracy, loss) is significantly lower than expected, the privacy budget 𝜀 can be increased to reduce noise and improve model utility. The adjustment follows:\n𝜀 𝑡+1 = 𝜀 𝑡 + 𝛽 • 𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 -𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑦\nWhere 𝛽 is a hyperparameter that controls the rate of adjustment.

Our performance evaluation focuses on two key metrics :\nPrivacy guarantee: we measure the privacy loss across different privacy budgets 𝜀 to quantify the level of privacy protection. Smaller 𝜀 values correspond to stronger privacy guarantees but may impact the utility of the trained model.\nModel accuracy: we assess the model's predictive performance under different privacy settings, comparing the accuracy of the trained model when using noisy data and noisy gradients versus a baseline model trained without privacy-preserving mechanisms."

      "title": "Privacy-Accuracy Trade-off",
      "content": "In this section, we explore the delicate balance between privacy protection and model accuracy, a crucial aspect in privacy-preserving machine learning. Our proposed method demonstrates a well-optimized trade-off between these two factors. The level of privacy protection is primarily controlled by the privacy budget 𝜀, with lower values of 𝜀 offering stronger privacy but potentially impacting the model's accuracy. However, we found that for moderate values of 𝜀, the model maintains a high level of accuracy while still providing strong privacy guarantees.\nOne key innovation of our approach is the dynamic noise adjustment mechanism. Instead of using a static level of noise throughout the training process, the noise level is dynamically adjusted based on real-time model performance metrics. During early training iterations, when the model is more sensitive to noise, a lower noise level is applied. As the model converges, and the gradients become smaller, higher noise levels can be introduced without significantly degrading model accuracy. This adaptive noise strategy helps optimize the privacy-accuracy tradeoff by ensuring that the model's predictive capabilities are preserved while still adhering to rigorous privacy standards."

      "title": "Scalability and Computational Efficiency",
      "content": "Scalability and computational efficiency are critical considerations for any privacy-preserving machine learning system, particularly in large-scale, distributed AI environments. Our proposed scheme excels in both these areas by leveraging the local application of differential privacy. Unlike traditional centralized methods, which require all data to be collected and processed at a central location, our method distributes the privacy-preserving computations across individual data sources. This decentralization significantly reduces the computational overhead and the bottleneck associated with central processing .\nIn distributed data fusion scenarios, where data is gathered from multiple, geographically dispersed nodes, the ability to perform local differential privacy computations minimizes data transmission costs and lowers the overall computational load on central servers. Each node adds noise locally before transmitting the data for model training, ensuring that privacy is preserved even if a node or communication channel is compromised.\nWe also evaluated the computational efficiency of our approach under different scales of data, including scenarios with millions of data points spread across multiple nodes. The results show that the time complexity of our approach scales linearly with the number of nodes, making it suitable for real-time AI applications where low-latency processing is essential. In terms of memory usage, the method incurs minimal additional overhead, as the noise addition and preprocessing steps are lightweight operations.\nCompared to traditional centralized differential privacy techniques, our local approach achieves a significant reduction in computational cost, improving efficiency by up to 40% in large-scale environments. This makes it particularly suitable for edge computing or IoT applications, where both privacy and computational resources are limited."
