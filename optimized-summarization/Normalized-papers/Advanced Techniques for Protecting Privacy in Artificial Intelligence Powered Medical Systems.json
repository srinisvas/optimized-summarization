      "content": "AI improves diagnostics, treatment plans, and healthcare procedures in modern medical systems. However, AI in medical systems creates serious patient safety issues . Medical record privacy and security become crucial as more healthcare data becomes digital and AI manages patient data. Medical systems that incorporate AI must apply advanced privacy protection to secure patient data while maximizing AI advantages . AI-powered medical systems have advanced in recent years, and many hospitals, clinics, and study groups employ them. Machine and deep learning have analyzed a vast amount of medical data. This has enabled early diagnosis, precision medicine, and personalized therapy . AI in imaging, pathology, genetics, and patient monitoring has improved healthcare understanding and efficiency. Meanwhile, researchers are gathering and analyzing massive amounts of personal health data. Massive patient data serves as the training ground for AI algorithms . We include personal data such as medical records, genetic information, and real-time health monitoring . More healthcare data raises concerns about privacy breaches, illicit access, and data misuse. Because of the increased incidence of healthcare facility intrusions, AI-powered systems require robust privacy safeguards . GDPR and HIPAA give some security. However, technological solutions must adapt to these developments. Patient privacy is important to AI-based medical solutions. This ensures that only authorized parties may access and utilize private health information for medical reasons. Morally, AI systems must obtain patients' consent and provide them with data control . Data minimization is a key privacy concept. It aims to reduce personal data collection, handling, and sharing. AI systems should only gather the necessary data for a task. This stops them from gathering excessive data that could potentially lead to a breach. AI processing also employs data anonymization and pseudonymization to safeguard patients' identities. These procedures remove medical record identifiers. This hinders AI algorithms' ability to link data to individuals . Safe data exchange helps physicians and professionals collaborate while respecting patient privacy. We can train AI models on distributed datasets thanks to new technologies like federated learning and secure multiparty computing. Each data point is protected . These privacy standards are critical for safeguarding patient data as AI advances healthcare. AIdriven medical systems require privacy protection, which has led to the proposal of several innovative solutions . Differential privacy is a sensible way to keep people out of records. Differential privacy adds noise or randomness to data before AI systems analyze it to safeguard confidentiality and statistical truth. Use homomorphic encryption to allow AI systems to calculate encrypted data without decoding it. This prevents AI processing from sharing sensitive patient data. This allows safe AI usage while maintaining privacy . For clinical research, homomorphic cryptography is an effective method for sending medical data across organizations or nations. Federated learning is another innovative privacy solution . Various datasets can train AI models. Shared learning lets healthcare firms contribute to an AI model while maintaining data ownership. This beats centralizing patient data. This method reduces data theft and allows for reliable AI models . Researchers have investigated blockchain technology as a tool to properly handle and monitor patient data, ensuring transparent utilization of AI systems."

      "content": "AI-powered medical systems have several inventive approaches to secure patient privacy while providing effective treatment. Differential privacy adds noise to datasets because it ensures that adding or deleting a data item has no impact . This strategy finds a beneficial balance between privacy and data value. Homomorphic encryption lets you calculate on protected data, which increases effort and wait times but improves security. Federated Learning trains models without a server. By saving data on local devices, we protect privacy without compromising model accuracy . Secure Multiparty Computation consists of many participants secretly calculating a function over their inputs. This takes longer and is more difficult, but it's secure. Blockchain-based protection improves data accuracy and security by leveraging the autonomy of blockchain technology. This monitors and restricts private data access . Data anonymization eliminates or modifies identifying information from datasets. This dramatically improves privacy but might lower data value if done incorrectly . By substituting private identifiers with bogus ones, pseudoanonymization maintains data relevance while masking identities. Synthetic data generation statistically mimics actual data. This allows data sharing without compromising privacy. Without requiring additional information, an individual can establish a claim. This is zero-knowledge proof. Finally, privacy-preserving data mining analyses data in a variety of ways without compromising privacy. While keeping things secret, we gain valuable knowledge .A comparison of privacy-preserving algorithms shows their merits and downsides in accuracy, precision, memory, F1 score, data value, processing waste, and security. Differential privacy has an accuracy of 85% and a security level of 8, indicating its ability to secure privacy while maintaining model performance . However, while homomorphic encryption boasts a security level of 9, it necessitates a longer processing time and more resources, thereby highlighting the associated costs of security. Data anonymization provides the most useful data (92% of the time) immediately, making it a good option for fast data access. Secure multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs are secure, but they may have scaling and implementation issues. Our ratings assist consumers in making appropriate privacy choices that meet security and AI-powered medical system speed requirements. Table 2 indicates how safe and beneficial private approaches are for AI-powered medical systems. We evaluate each technique based on its security, data value, latency, scale, legal compliance, and application difficulties. Homomorphic encryption has a high security score (9) but a considerable latency (300 ms), making it powerful yet sluggish. In contrast, data anonymization has low latency (40 ms) and high data usefulness (92%), making it ideal for applications that require data immediately. This infographic guides everyone in choosing the appropriate privacy settings for practical and security reasons."

It initializes the dataset and output function. Next, it determines function sensitivity and adds privacy-preserving Laplace distribution noise. The privacy budget (ρ^epsilonρ) controls noise and ensures that each individual's input remains private. Additional variables (π{sigmaπ) allow for adjustments depending on specific scenarios and repeated findings, making this technique more dependable. Add up the privacy lost by each question to gain a comprehensive picture of privacy requirements. While comparing privacy versus dataset insights, the software prioritizes output value review. Updates and iterative feedback mechanisms reduce noise, making private data management simpler. The program closes with extensive records and strong privacy regulations. We establish the groundwork for integrating AI into medical systems while respecting patient privacy. Figure 1 illustrates the process of enhancing the privacy of AI-based medical systems. First, it selects and estimates sensitive data. Next, it generates noise to protect privacy. This noise controls output and privacy. The approach uses multiple searches and considers global sensitivity when assessing usefulness. We review privacy assurances, feedback methods, and outcomes before the procedure ends. This systematic strategy protects privacy while preserving data. \no ∈ , ^= 1,2, … ,(29)\no KB J ? = ∑ + σ D(30)\no Δ KB J ? = max • [\\? : Input loss.\no !
