      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "content": "Generative AI (GenAI) technologies like GPT-4 and DALL.E have transformed industries by automating tasks such as content creation, language translation, and data analysis . These advancements have driven efficiency and innovation in fields like healthcare, education, and transportation [?]. However, they also introduce critical ethical challenges, including biases, misinformation, and privacy risks . Traditional software engineering practices prioritize code correctness and performance but often neglect these ethical complexities.\nThis paper introduces the concept of Values Debt-the ethical and operational deficits arising from insufficient attention to ethical principles during AI development . To address this, we propose integrating the Helpful, Honest, Harmless (HHH) framework into AI engineering practices. The HHH framework ensures AI systems are helpful by meeting user needs, honest through accurate and transparent outputs, and harmless by preventing societal harm and fostering ethical operation. Using a case study of a chatbot developed using Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for aviation safety, we demonstrate how this framework effectively mitigates Values Debt and aligns AI systems with human values.\nThis paper highlights how Values Debt manifests in GenAIbased applications and addresses the key research question:\n• How can the HHH framework mitigate Values Debt and align AI systems with human values? II. UNDERSTANDING VALUES DEBT Values Debt, analogous to technical debt, refers to the ethical and operational deficits that accumulate during the de-velopment and deployment of AI systems . Unlike technical debt, which arises from coding shortcuts, Values Debt stems from neglecting ethical considerations, often remaining hidden until after deployment and complicating remediation efforts.\nThe development of Generative AI is driven by diverse intentions, ranging from benign innovation to malicious exploitation, influenced by factors such as the pursuit of innovation, power dynamics, and market dominance , . This rapid advancement prioritizes short-term gains over longterm ethical standards, leading to significant Values Debt that compromises the integrity and societal trust in AI technologies."

      "title": "Manifestations and Implications of Values Debt",
      "content": "Generative AI systems frequently launch with inherent biases, inaccuracies, and ethical issues due to poor-quality or non-inclusive training datasets sourced from internet wikis, websites, blogs, and videos. The rush to capture market share, achieve short-term financial gains, adhere to research agendas, and occasional oversight compromises ethical rigour, resulting in long-term societal and organizational risks , , .\nDisinformation and Malicious Applications: Generative AI's ability to produce realistic yet false content facilitates disinformation campaigns, deepfakes, and fraud. AI hallucinations-where systems generate plausible but inaccurate information-exacerbate misinformation risks, undermining public trust and threatening security .\nSocial Injustice and Bias: AI models often replicate and amplify societal biases present in their training data, resulting in discriminatory outcomes. For example, Amazon's AI recruitment tool favoured male candidates due to biased data, leading to its discontinuation . Similarly, Google's internal conflicts over ethical AI practices, highlighted by the departure of AI researcher Timnit Gebru, reveal organizational tensions from misaligned values .\nReputational and Legal Implications: Values Debt can lead to reputational harm, legal challenges, and loss of consumer trust. Unethical AI systems risk public backlash, lawsuits, and diminished market share . Addressing these issues post-deployment is more costly and complex than integrating ethical considerations during development .\nAddressing Values Debt requires embedding ethical considerations throughout the AI development lifecycle. By moving from a purely functional approach to one that incorporates ethical principles, AI systems can align with the Helpful, Honest, Harmless (HHH) framework ."

      "title": "Graph RAG Implementation",
      "content": "We built a Neo4j knowledge graph using NASA's ASRS incident reports and relevant communication theories, capturing key entities (e.g., CommunicationBreakdown, Aircraft, Incident, Anomaly) and their relationships. User queries map to these graph nodes and edges, anchoring GPT-4's generative output in validated domain data. This structure mitigates misinformation risks, provides transparency about data provenance, and aligns with the Helpful, Honest, Harmless principles.\nGraph RAG leverages this knowledge graph by employing community detection algorithms to group related entities into \"communities.\" Each community is summarized in parallel, and the partial summaries are merged into a comprehensive final answer using a map-reduce strategy . By structuring data graphically, Graph RAG reduces hallucinations, provides clearer causal links, and enhances both the diversity and completeness of answers-especially in large-scale or highstakes contexts.\nEmpirical evaluations demonstrate that Graph RAG significantly outperforms naïve RAG in both comprehensiveness and diversity of answers, making it ideal for high-stakes applications like aviation safety that require global insights. Additionally, Graph RAG's intermediate and low-level community summaries surpass source text summarization on these metrics while reducing token costs .\nGRAISE leverages Graph RAG to enhance pilot training by integrating GPT-4 with the aviation-specific knowledge graph. By evaluating incident narratives through established communication theories , GRAISE provides context-sensitive feedback that supports pilot decision-making and mitigates ethical risks tied to misinformation."
