      "content": "This paper proposes a methodology for evaluating the ethical impact of artificial intelligence (AI) systems on people and society based on AI ethics guidelines. The ethical impact of AI has been recognized as a social issue, and countries and organizations have formulated principles and guidelines on AI ethics, and laws and regulations will be enforced in Europe. Because these principles and guidelines are written in terms of philosophy and law, AI service providers, developers, and business users have the challenge of how they should practice the principles and guidelines to their AI systems. To address this challenge, we first analyzed cases of ethical problems caused by AI in the past and assumed that ethical problems could be linked to interactions between components of AI systems and stakeholders related to such systems. On the basis of this assumption , we then developed a methodology to comprehensively extract the ethical risks that an AI system poses. This methodology consists of two approaches. The first approach is to develop an AI ethics model that embodies ethics guidelines as necessary requirements for ethical AI systems and correlates these requirements with interactions. The second approach is an impact assessment process that uses the AI ethics models to extract ethical risks for individual AI systems. In this paper, we discuss the details of this methodology and show the results of an initial validation to verify the above assumption and the ease of the impact assessment process."

      "content": "The ethical impact of artificial intelligence (AI) has become recognized as a social issue, and ethical principles and guidelines that provide the basic requirements for the spread of responsible AI are being developed . In Europe, the European Commission published a draft AI regulation called the Artificial Intelligence Act , which categorizes the manipulation of people's subconscious, the use of social scoring, and remote biometrics for law-enforcement purposes in public spaces as prohibited AI systems. It also lists the uses of AI in personal biometrics and classification and its application to critical infrastructure as \"high-risk AI\" and imposes a number of requirements for its use in these fields with significant fines for violations. In the United States, a bill known as the \"Facial Recognition and Biometric Technology Moratorium Act\" , which prohibits federal officials from using facial-recognition technology, has been proposed. The city of San Francisco has also banned the use of facialrecognition technology by police.\nThe movement from ethical principles to practice has become active. To comply with ethics guidelines, the development of technology to address ethical issues related to the fairness of AI is moving forward. Several standards have been defined regarding fairness. For example, for sensitive attributes, such as race and gender for which fairness is being considered, there is one approach that equalizes the probability of the potential outputs provided by AI (for example, for recruitment AI, the hiring and rejection of candidates), and another that equalizes the probability of AI output being used in correct data. Machine learning algorithms that follow these various standards are being extensively studied . A technique for taking into account fairness in relation to multiple sensitive attributes and a concept for an interface design for end users to judge and deal with fairness in AI have also been proposed.\nCompanies are also beginning to implement principles into practice. Many companies have their own AI ethics guidelines. Companies that are making an effort to follow their guidelines have published practical examples and assessment tools, such as open toolkit for fairness and transparency in implementing the guidelines and assessment tools .\nIn this paper, we define \"AI ethical impact\" as the ethical impact of the use of AI systems on stakeholders or the ethical impact of stakeholders on AI systems and other stakeholders. The purpose of our research was to provide a methodology for AI service providers, AI developers, and business users who are non-AI ethics experts to evaluate the ethical impact of their AI systems on the basis of AI ethics guidelines and recognize where and what risks may occur in AI systems.\nSince AI principles and guidelines are written in the language of law and philosophy, for non-AI ethics experts, reading and comprehending these principles and guidelines, and putting them into practice in their AI systems can be burdensome. Even when using the various impact assessment frameworks discussed above, it is likely that knowledge of AI ethics and past case analysis will be required to apply them to AI systems.\nTo address this issue, we assumed that systematizing ethical problems caused by AI in the past would enable conducting impact assessment procedurally for various AI use cases. From a survey of past AI ethical incident cases, we assumed that ethical risks are mapped to the interactions between the components of an AI system and the stakeholders directly or indirectly involved with the system.\nOn the basis of this assumption, we propose a methodology called AI Ethics Impact Assessment for comprehensively identifying ethical problems caused by AI by associating the requirements for responsible AI described in the ethics guidelines with the interactions that appear in AI systems. The methodology consists of two approaches based on the requirements engineering approach.\nApproach 1: Building an AI ethics model. Embody written ethical guidelines as requirements necessary for AI systems to be ethical, and map these requirements to interactions. Ethical risk can be treated as a situation contrary to the requirements associated with the interaction. Approach 2: Impact assessment process. The process of extracting ethical risks for individual AI systems using the AI ethics model is presented.\nUsing the AI Ethics Impact Assessment, AI developers, providers, and users without expertise in ethical guidelines can assess ethical risks at each stage of the AI lifecycle, from planning to development, operation, and retirement. We discuss the details of the two approaches of AI Ethics Impact Assessment, i.e., AI ethics model and ethics impact assessment process, our initial validation on the above assumption, the ease of the impact assessment process, and the effectiveness and issues concerning the AI Ethics Impact Assessment.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section II introduces related work, Section III describes the concept for systematizing and evaluating ethical impact, Section IV describes the AI Ethics Impact Assessment, i.e., AI ethical impact assessment using the AI ethics model, Section V describes the initial validation of our methodology, and Section VI presents conclusions and future issues."

      "content": "In this section, we introduce AI impact assessment and related work. The Canadian government has issued guidance on Automated Decision-Making and provided a tool to assess the impact of algorithms on decision-making systems. As a method to implementing ethically aligned AI in software engineering, ECCOLA offers 21 cards in 8 themes based on IEEE's (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Ethically Aligned Design guidelines and EU AI HLEG's (High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence) Trustworthy AI guidelines . The Algorithm Impact Assessment toolkit from the Ada Lovelace Institute was developed to assess the impact of AI on medical imaging. Floridi et al. provided guidance on the conformity assessment of AI systems on the basis of the European Artificial Intelligence Act proposal . NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) also categorizes AI biases and reports challenges and guidance .\nIn the field of software engineering, Borg et al. demonstrated the applicability of ALTAI (Assessment List for Trustworthy AI) to ongoing development projects and showed that the scope of its evaluation was not only related to developers and providers but also to social and environmental issues.\nJohnson et al. surveyed research on ethical software practices in the process of developing, evaluating, and maintaining data-driven software .\nThe risk chain model for assessing ethical risks has also been proposed . This model provides a framework for AI service providers to consider risk assessment and control of their AI services. The relationship between risk scenarios and risk factors in an AI system is visualized, and the examination of risk control is enabled on the basis of this visualization."

      "title": "Initial analysis of ethical imapct using past cases",
      "content": "We thought that if we could systematize how ethical issues arise from AI in several patterns, it would be helpful for AI developers, providers, and other stakeholders who understand the specifications and use cases of their AI systems to conduct impact assessments. Accordingly, we analyzed past ethical cases and consider how to systematize these cases.\nAs an initial analysis, we focused on the fairness issue and examined the ethical incidents on credit card applications, recruitment AI, and recidivism risk prediction from the AI Incident database . In each case, we clarified which stakeholders were affected by the fairness issue then identified the causes of the issue, referring to a survey on fairness-aware machine learning . Next, we identified the stakeholders and components of the AI system in each case and created a diagram to visualize their relationships. We then visualized in the diagram the fairness issue and its causes. In this analysis, we used 2 use cases (loan screening AI and mental healthcare AI) from the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) /IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) AI use case and 3 use cases from interviews with AI projects related to image recognition to sort out the types of stakeholders and AI system components. Table I shows the types of components of an AI system and stakeholders.\nWe investigated examples of past ethical problems and whether there were common patterns in the way the ethical problems occurred through the following procedure.\nThe use cases in which a past ethical issue occurred are first represented by the components and stakeholders of an AI system and the interactions between them. The visualization of the components, stakeholders, and interactions is called a system diagram.\nThe ethical issue is then mapped on a system diagram. Take loan screening AI as an example. The loan screening AI determines whether a loan application is approved on the basis of the attributes, transaction history, and credit score of the loan applicant. The loan officer makes a final decision on the basis of the AI results and responds to the applicant. The teacher label of training data is based on the repayment performance of past loan applicants. It has been pointed out that the results of loan screening AI are biased regarding gender.\nFigure 1 shows where the ethical risks of loan screening AI appear. The diagram shows a simplified AI system, with loan officers and loan applicants as stakeholders. Arrows connecting the AI system's components and stakeholders represent interactions.\nThe ethical risks that can be mapped to each of the following four interactions are shown:\nFrom training data to AI models: Gender bias is learned from training data and reflected in the AI model."

      "title": "AI ethics model",
      "content": "We first describe an AI ethics model required to extract AI ethical risks. An AI ethics model comprehensively indicates the characteristics that an ethical AI system should have. Individual characteristics included in an AI ethics model are called AI ethical characteristics. An AI ethics model organizes and defines its characteristics hierarchically.\nIn this context, an AI system is an IT system that uses technologies related to AI. It is assumed to include not only AI models generated using machine learning and statistical analysis but also to be a system in which processing components required for IT systems are combined. Stakeholders directly or indirectly involved in AI systems are also included in the AI ethics model.\nThe range of AI ethical characteristics of an AI ethics model should be within the range indicated in the ethical guidelines. We believe that ethical guidelines can be embodied in requirements that AI systems must have. This is based on the concept of requirements engineering. The user experience (UX) quality model combines a top-down approach with a bottom-up approach to comprehensively collect and organize UX quality characteristics. Specifically, the UX quality model is expressed in four levels: the upper two levels are expressed using the definition of SQuaRE (Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation) , and the lower two levels are embodied using the results of UX evaluation by the user. Through this approach, a practical model can be constructed by comprehensively expressing quality characteristics in the upper levels and preventing excessive embodiment in the lower levels. We use this concept to construct an AI ethics model.\nAn AI ethics model is also expressed in a four-level structure. In the top-down approach, the text of the ethical guidelines is structured in the upper two levels. In the bottomup approach, regarding ethical problems obtained from the analysis of AI system use cases and AI system cases that caused problems in the past from the AI Incident database published by Partnership on AI (a non-profit organization that promotes AI), the characteristics that can be obtained by solving the problems are extracted as AI ethical characteristics. These characteristics are embodied in the lower two levels, and guidelines and AI ethical characteristics are made to correspond to each other.\nThe type of interaction (for example, AI ethical characteristics related to AI fairness include handling interactions from AI outputs to business users, etc.) to satisfy each AI ethical characteristic is extracted and correlated. In this case, several interactions may correspond to one AI ethical characteristic, and one interaction may correspond to several AI ethical characteristics. This prevents interactions and AI ethical characteristics from becoming incompatible. The above approaches provide the following advantages: By basing the approaches on ethical guidelines, it is possible to ensure completeness in the sense of compliance with these guidelines.\nBecause interactions in AI systems correspond to AI ethical characteristics and guidelines correspond to the upper levels of AI ethical characteristics, it is possible to clarify to which part of the guidelines an interaction should correspond. This makes it easier to consider measures such as technical solutions or operational measures.\nFigure 2 shows an overview of an AI ethics model. The first layer of the AI ethics model corresponds to the seven requirements (\"Human agency and oversight\", \"Technical robustness and safety\", \"Privacy and data governance\", \"Transparency\", \"Diversity, non-discrimination, and fairness\", \"Societal and environmental well-being\", \"Accountability\") from the EU AI HLEG's ethics guidelines for Trustworthy AI (Trustworthy AI) . The second and lower layers are structured from Assessment Lists of the Trustworthy AI (ALTAI) . Each node of the fourth layer is associated with an interaction defined in the previous section III We represent AI ethics model in table format shown in TABLE II. \"Category 1\" to \"Category 4\" columns of the table correspond to the AI ethics model in which Trustworthy AI and ALTAI are structured and embodied in four layers. \"Category 4\" is the AI ethical characteristic.\nEach AI ethical characteristic is associated with the type of interaction (combination of the \"type of a start point of interaction\" and \"type of an end point of interaction\"). Multiple types of interactions may correspond to one AI ethical characteristic. \"Summary\" is a description of AI ethical characteristics. \"Risk event or risk factor example\" describes examples of risks extracted from analysis of past incident cases.\nFor example, an AI ethical characteristic called \"Maintenance of social trust\" is associated with an interaction between a business user and judgment target. A situation in which the target system violates this requirement constitutes an ethical risk. In the example of the loan screening AI mentioned in the previous section, this requirement allows the loan officer to make final decisions that heavily depend on the AI results to be extracted as an ethical risk. With this approach, it is possible to conduct impact assessments for various use cases by creating an AI ethics model once per guideline."

To facilitate this task, the AI ethics model has a description of for each AI ethical characteristic and an example risk extracted from the analysis of past cases.\nThe following is an example of loan screening AI. Figure 4 is the system diagram created in step 1. The arrows in the system diagram are the interactions. The number attached to the arrow is the ID of the interaction. Table III lists the AI ethical characteristics corresponding to interactions and their descriptions generated in step 2. Consider an example of extracting risks for interaction ID 105 in Table III. AI ethics characteristics linked to ID 105 are \"Group fairness\". The \"summary\" of \"Group fairness\" is that the \"Difference of interference results by AI are within the tolerance range between groups of protection attributes\". The statement describes an ethical situation, and the risk would be a situation that violates the statement. ID 105 is an interaction from the AI model to the inference result, and the risk that can occur in this interaction is extracted as \"the result is unfair according to gender or race.\" A practical guide for conducting this impact assessment process consisting of procedures, AI ethics models, and analysis sheets has been published . Case studies using the impact assessment process for certain use cases have also been published."

A questionnaire survey of participants was conducted as an initial validation of our methodology. The results of the questionnaire suggested the validity of our assumption that ethical risks can be associated to interactions between AI systems and stakeholders. However, problems remain with the small number of participants, the bias toward those who have knowledge of AI ethics, and the setting of questions. In the future, it is important to improve the verification method and show reliable results."
