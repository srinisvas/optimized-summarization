      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "content": "Despite advances in technology, brain tumors remain the most common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and early diagnosis is key to effective treatment. MRI-based non-invasive diagnosis has become the cornerstone, but manual interpretation is labor-intensive and error-prone, thus delaying treatment. Recent advancements in AI, especially deep learning models including CNNs, have revamped automated brain tumor detection. However, despite all these advancements, much remains to be addressed, such as data privacy concerns with AI, the black-box nature of the current AI models, and the demand for real-time clinical processing .\nThe paper addresses these challenges using a unified approach that integrates FL for privacy, XAI for transparency, and deep learning for precision diagnosis.\nThis work explores an integrated approach combining Federated Learning(FL) for data privacy , Explainable AI(XAI) for model transparency, and deep learning for precise tumour diagnosis. The goal of this project is to provide a clinically useful, interpretable, and privacy-preserving diagnostic system. The contributions of this paper are the following.\n• Federated Learning for privacy-preserving cooperative model training. • Explainable AI for transparent models using SHAP and LIME . • Current methods will be analyzed, with its shortcomings and potential directions toward future research.\nDeep learning, specifically CNNs, has been widely applied in recent research for brain tumor diagnosis from MRI scans. Their \"black-box\" nature poses significant challenges even though they achieve high accuracy, especially in clinical scenarios where interpretability is a concern . Federated Learning, which promises to offer privacy-friendly co-operative model training across institutions without sharing raw data, is emerging as a possible solution to these problems . However, the problems of data heterogeneity and communication overhead still persist as validated by studies.\nAt the same time, XAI techniques like SHAP and LIME are improving model usability and trust while providing critical information on what influences predictions . Recent studies have emphasized the importance of model interpretability, especially in clinical settings where transparency is the basis of clinical decision-making. In the proposed model, combining FL with XAI to create a model that balances privacy, interpretability, and diagnostic accuracy best for the improvement of validity and reliability in AI-driven systems of brain tumor detection. Addressing data heterogeneity and providing realtime complex explanations may help in creating adaptive and reliable AI models in real-world clinical settings ."

      "title": "Purpose",
      "content": "• Performance Metric: In the XAI framework, interpretability and diagnostic accuracy are the assessment criteria, and the system efficiency is the assessment criteria for FL. • Advantages and Disadvantages: The two main adverse features of XAI and FL are the type of transparency, privacy, specifically computational cost, and the heterogeneity of the data. • Federated Learning Challenges: There is also the issue of the computational cost and the real-time responsiveness of the specificity of the explanations . This, in turn, gives rise to the idea of reducing FL communication overhead and thus facilitates the increase in the efficiency with which the model itself aggregates, notably when processing a large data set . • Generalization Improvements: Some of the ways to overcome them include:\n-Enhance the diversity and stability of the data set to do well for other MRI scans. -Real-time Learning: Provide planning as an option for obtaining speed and accuracy of the predictive model within the framework of a stable clinical setting. -Powerful XAI Methods: Investigate other options for stronger feature-specific or approximate explanation generation that reduce the cost of time.\n• Significance of the Approach: This is the reason the integrated approach makes it possible to reprieve in trusting the AI systems, getting over the gap of theoretical AI and practical usage and arriving at much more accurate diagnostic solutions and at the same time cheaper to the clinicians ."

      "title": "PROPOSED METHOD",
      "content": "In the proposed method, the federated learning (FL), explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), and deep learning are used to provide an integrated approach for brain tumour diagnosis. The three primary components of the system design are a CNN model for tumour classification, XAI for interpretability, and FL for private model training .\nFederated Learning: FL allows the training of collaborative models across institutions without having to share raw MRI data, thus preserving privacy. The Federated Averaging Algorithm aggregates local model updates on a central server while maintaining confidentiality of individual data .\nFederated Averaging Algorithm:\nThe Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm from (1) updates the global model parameters by aggregating the locally computed updates from participating devices. The update rule is expressed as follows:\nw t+1 = 1 n n i=1 w i t (1\n)\nwhere w t+1 represents the updated global model parameters at time t+1, n is the total number of participating devices, and \nw i t denotes\nw i = 1 H•W j,k ∂yc ∂A i,j,k Compute weighted sum H = C i=1 w i A i Normalize H to return H\nThe Grad-CAM algorithm stated in Algorithm 2 helps visualize which regions in an input image x have the most influence on the model's prediction for a particular class c. The process works in the following steps:\n• Forward Pass: The model first makes a prediction y = M (x) based on the input image and extracts the feature maps A from the last convolutional layer. • Backward Pass: Then, the algorithm calculates the gradients ∂yc ∂A , which tell us how much each feature map contributes to the prediction for the target class c.\n• Weighting: For each feature map, a weight w i is computed, which is the average of the gradients across all spatial locations in the feature map. • Heatmap Generation: The weighted feature maps are combined to form a heatmap H, which highlights the areas in the image most relevant to the class prediction. Finally, the heatmap is normalized to the range to make it easier to interpret and visualize.\nModel Evaluation: Well-known criteria such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score are used to evaluate the proposed model. Figure 1 depicts the architecture of the proposed Explainable AI and Federated Learning-based brain tumour detection system. Federated Learning preserves patient privacy by allowing medical institutions to collectively work on model training without having to share their private MRI data .\nIn this architectural design:\n• Information Gathering: Information is collected and stored locally at each participating site from MRI scans. FL allows organizations to train models locally on the organization's data, and no data is exchanged during the training procedure . the logic behind a specific prediction, such as the presence of a tumor, these methods increase the dependability and accessibility of the system for doctors . With perfect accuracy and interpretability of the results used to determine its performance, the clarity in decision-making and a precise diagnosis of the brain tumor are guaranteed.\nLocal training and aggregation through generation of explainable predictions in a collaborative setting with privacy, this architecture diagram helps the reader understand the workflow of processing MRI scan data .\nFigure 2 shows a flowchart describing the sequential steps of the brain tumour detection pipeline. This flowchart starts from the data collection phase, where MRI scans are collected from different institutions. During the local model training stage, which uses FL to train machine learning models inside each institution, the privacy of individual datasets is maintained. This is further improved using model aggregation on a central server to generate the global model. After the training of the model, XAI methods are applied to the model in order to provide explanations for its predictions. The output is forwarded for clinical assessment. The data processing and process flow of the system are easily comprehensible from this flowchart."

      "content": "Evaluated Result of the proposed system using a dataset of MRI scans from figshare Brain Tumor dataset. The system achieved the following performance metrics:\n• Accuracy: 96.8% • Sensitivity: 96.5% These results indicate that while ensuring privacy through FL, the proposed system outperforms the traditional CNN models in terms of accuracy and reliability . With SHAP and LIME providing explainable explanations for every decision, the integration of XAI ensures that physicians can trust the predictions of the system . Despite these successes, the cost of transmission overhead makes it challenging to improve the real-time processing of federated models. Future work will focus on lowering computational cost and improving the FL framework for faster aggregation. To improve model generalization across different tumour types and MRI techniques, including bigger and more diverse datasets can help .\nFigure 3 Illustrates a plasma chart of main system performance indicators such as Federated Learning Performance, Real-time Processing Capability and XAI Interpretability. All such indicators are analyzed for seeing how the system performs in these varied situations. The trade off between the processing time with the interpretability as well as accuracy is represented in the chart as below:\n• XAI Interpretability: Judges the degree to which doctors should understand what the model is proposing. • Federated Learning Performance: Reflects the ability of a model to train in a group setting but keep itself private."

      "content": "• Real-time Processing: This indicates how quickly the system can make predictions based on MRI data. The plasma chart graphically represents all these indicators of overall efficiency and the trade-offs between them to make it easier to understand the system's efficacy. The Figure 4 outlines the performances of several models developed in AI for detection in cases of brain tu- .I mors. These models deliver good performance but should be well explained regarding their interpretability. The process of decision-making with explainable AI can unveil more robust and trustable diagnosis results. Therefore, there should be more emphasis in research studies on developing methods in explainable AI, which would contribute towards higher transparency and usability of the models in the clinic .\nTable I compares the performance of several machine learning models and evaluates the predictability of algorithms' predictions as well as their accuracy in identifying brain tumors. To show how FL influences model performance without losing the privacy, models trained using FL are compared with traditional centralised models. The table also displays a number of explainability ratings of several XAI strategies among them SHAP and LIME, showing how well these approaches produce predictions that can be understood . Table II presents a detailed comparison of Federated Learning (FL) models and traditional centralized models in terms of their training efficiency, accuracy, and data privacy features. This also shows how FL enables organisations to create cooperative models without disclosing private information. It compares the accuracy of both types of models, their training time, and their ability to maintain privacy during the training process and the benefits of using FL in medical settings, particularly in scenarios where patient data privacy is of utmost importance."

      "title": "CONCLUSION",
      "content": "To overcome the major hurdles of MRI scan diagnosis of brain tumors, this research proposal with integrated approach based on Explainable AI (XAI) and Federated Learning (FL) to protect data privacy by having institutions work together to build models without exchanging private information. Besides, XAI techniques such as SHAP and LIME provide explainable explanations of what the AI system has learned while making its decisions, hence promoting transparency. The results demonstrate how this strategy works well to enhance the interpretability and accuracy of the diagnosis, which makes the clinicians have confidence in the system. However, the current approach has a number of shortcomings. The first reason is that longer training timeframes and greater processing demands are caused by federated learning typically being a computationally demanding operation, especially when aggregating models, when working with large datasets or complicated models. The second is that, even if Federated Learning is improving privacy and collaboration, data heterogeneity between the institutions like different MRI scan quality or imaging techniques may have an impact on how well it performs. The interpretability of XAI makes it computationally expensive to produce an explanation of each prediction, which may affect real-time processing in the healthcare industry.\nThe limitations will be addressed by further improving future work so that the system will further be extended. The federated learning process will be optimized with regards to communication overhead in terms of reducing the time consumed for model aggregation in training. It will also be directed in efforts for improving model robustness by increasing the size and variety of more diverse datasets from more institutions for generalizing performance across varied MRI scan protocols. On top of that, real-time clinical integration will emphasize optimizing a system to fast, accurate predictions with detailed explanations able to fit a clinical workflow seamlessly. Finally, in order to further reduce the computational cost of XAI, advanced methods for faster generation of explanations will be further explored. This may happen by either focusing on specific features or through approximation techniques. In summary, though the existing system gives a good solid foundation to the diagnosis system for brain tumors, this advancement will allow its applicability in real clinical conditions, and thus AI-based diagnosis will be more dependable, efficient, and accessible to clinicians."
