      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "content": "Cloud computing is spreading so rapidly that it has driven organizations towards higher dependence on several cloud platforms to meet divergent storage, computation, and collaboration needs. Cross-cloud architecture makes organizations more flexible, cost-effective, and resilient by leveraging the unique features of various cloud providers. Ensuring privacy and security becomes fundamental when data crosses these interrelated cloud environments. Cloud service providers' different security policies and protocols increase the risks of unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations. This is one more reason why it's getting so complex in organizations to maintain a secure but seamless and efficient process for sharing data across multiple clouds ."

      "title": "Overview of Existing Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms in Cloud Systems",
      "content": "Therefore, the rise of cloud computing has encouraged active research in developing mechanisms that ensure data security in both storage and sharing using platforms that offer different levels of privacy preservation. For instance, the encryption techniques of AES and RSA are widely used for data protection at rest or during transmission. However, they create a lot of obstacles in cross-cloud scenarios owing to computational overheads and fundamental management complexities. More advanced approaches, like ABE, can enable flexible, role-based access control, reducing various risks against unauthorized access . So far, notions such as homomorphic encryption have enabled computations over encrypted data without exposing their contents. While it is very promising in theory, because of the high computational costs, it is far from realistic for big deployments over the cloud. On the other hand, SMC enables joint processing without sharing raw information. At the same time, differential privacy investigates protection at an individual record level by adding noise at a statistical level. However, when applied in cross-cloud environments, most are plagued with interoperability problems and show complex issues while applying consistent privacy policies ."

      "title": "AI-Based Methods for Safe Data Exchange",
      "content": "AI-driven methods open new horizons for improving the privacy of cross-cloud data sharing. For instance, machine learning models can go through vast volumes of information to identify the appearance of potential threats and anomalies in the flows, enriching real-time security monitoring. The most outstanding of all the AI-based methods is federated learning, which enables several parties to collaboratively work on model training without exposing the raw data. This opens up the possibilities for decentralized model training whereby only model updates must be shared, which has much lower associated privacy risks. Applications of federated learning can be perfectly realized in industries like health care that want co-modeling but with the guarantee of data confidentiality . AI also empowers better data security because of differential privacy. In this respect, differential privacy injects controlled noise into the training process in AI for any single point of data to remain secure when model precision is preserved. Leading companies in AI-powered applications have used This approach to secure user data. Furthermore, reinforcement learning allows runtime dynamic encryption strategies to factor in contextual variables on data sensitivity and threat level for runtime optimization against security measures. Of course, this adapts an efficient approach that does not sacrifice robust security when reducing computational overhead .\nOnce applied in large-scale cross-cloud settings, the AI algorithms also automate key management; the mechanisms will reduce manual complexities. Automating the critical rotation/revocation processes may mitigate risks connected to key compromise or unauthorized access."

      "title": "Limitations of Existing Protocols for Cross-Cloud Shares",
      "content": "Due to heterogeneity, a significant challenge remains in securely sharing the data across cloud platforms. Each runs under a different security protocol and data governance framework that complicates uniform mechanisms of privacy implementation. Moreover, privacy risks and compliance issues arise while sharing data across heterogeneous clouds. Besides this, scalability and performance problems also arise from conventional methods. Solutions involving homomorphic encryption are computation-intensive and, hence, not practical for large-scale deployment. Another alternative is differential privacy, which consists of a trade-off between noise addition and data utility, thus degrading the accuracy of the shared data .\nAnother weakness the traditional encryption-based methods face is context awareness; data sensitivity may differ based on the user role or application context. Current protocols have mostly been static and cannot prepare for this type of variability in handling, thus resulting in underprotection or over-encryption. Another challenge is adherence to various regulatory frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation. Even supported by automated AIbased checks, achieving standardized privacy practices across these many jurisdictions can remain insurmountable. While the AI models themselves may significantly automate compliance, a need exists for standard frameworks to put any policy into practice uniformly .\nHowever, even secure cross-cloud sharing will not make the task easy on the reliability of the AI models. Reliability grows with the quality of the training data. Models must be refreshed to nullify false positives and omit open vulnerabilities in cloud environments characterized by dynamically changing re-emerging threats and data types. In addition to that, AI algorithms could also be susceptible to adversarial attacks, which are when a malicious actor tries to deliberately manipulate input in order, for instance, to trick a model into giving away privacy. Finally, the higher contribution of AI to privacy mechanisms engenders a great deal of trust and transparency issues: the decisions about access and encryption driven by AI have to be understandable with organizational security policies in place. Otherwise, the reduction in effectiveness because of trust problems is well expected for AI-driven solutions operating in multi-cloud environments ."

The module discussed here continuously monitors contextual parameters such as user roles, application usage, and geographic location and updates the security policies accordingly. It may mean varying levels of encryption, such as data transferred within a regulatorycompliant region versus across borders.\nFinally, the layer of Cross-Cloud Collaboration ensures data interoperability across cloud platforms for maintaining consistent application of protocols related to privacy among participating clouds.

      "title": "Comparative Analysis with Existing Protocols",
      "content": "The proposed protocols are compared to cloud privacypreserving protocols, such as the Standard Multi-Party Computation (SMC) Protocol and Traditional Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE). The comparison is based on the attained privacy and security concerning performance metrics by experimental simulation results • Privacy Score: It defines the effectiveness of a privacypreserving system, like the level of data anonymization employed by each protocol.\n• Attack Resistance: The percentage of simulated attacks detected and contained.\n• Latency: On average, time is taken to encrypt and share data across clouds; the lower the value, the better the information processing is in less time.\n• Resource Utilization: CPU and memory usage of the system in performing encryption and sharing operations. The results show that the proposed AI-driven protocols ensure better security and privacy with higher performance than the state-of-the-art techniques. For example, the latency of the proposed protocol is minimal, around 50ms compared to SMC and ABE, with 120ms and 150ms, respectively. Similarly, Case also presented that the proposed protocols have better resistance against attacks, up to 98%, which proved efficient in protecting shared data among various clouds."

      "content": "Consequently, this paper introduced the AI-generated privacy-preserving protocols for cross-cloud data sharing and collaboration. The solution also integrated federated learning, thus allowing secure model training without transferring raw data, ensuring data confidentiality across diverse cloud platforms. For additional security, differential privacy methods were used to prevent reverse engineering of each data point. At the same time, the dynamic encryption engine provided context security awareness depending on the sensitivity of detected data and threats. The proposed protocols were experimentally deployed on a simulated multicloud environment to show their effectiveness in higher privacy scores, with attack resistance compared to traditional protocols. At the same time, latency remains low, and resource utilization is optimized. These findings confirm the applicability of the proposed protocols in real-world multi-cloud scenarios for better privacy and security with no penalty in performance."

That would ensure efficient use of computing powers during high-demand conditions. Second, enhancing model aggregation techniques within federated learning reduces the communication overhead between participating cloud environments, which is a desirable outcome, especially in large-scale deployments. Finally, differential privacy techniques need optimization in balancing privacy and data utility to make data analytics effective and protect sensitive information ."

      "content": "Looking ahead, some promising research directions could even further improve security and privacy in cross-cloud data sharing. First, this deals with using zero-knowledge proofs and protocols based on AI. Generally speaking, zeroknowledge proof verifies data integrity and authenticity without exposing sensitive information, thus providing advanced means for privacy protection. Another relevant research direction that is supposed to be developed in the future concerns the creation of quantum-resistant privacy protocols. With the growth of quantum capabilities, it might be relevant to add quantum-resistant methods in the protocols generated by AI. Further, integrating AI and blockchain will facilitate cross-cloud auditing systems where the system will be transparent and immutable, hence building trust and responsibility in a multi-cloud environment . After all, improved protocols generated through AI are a ray of hope for secure and efficient data sharing across clouds. Refining the existing methods by exploring new technologies will make these protocols evolve in light of recent challenges related to data privacy in the increasingly complex cloud ecosystem."
