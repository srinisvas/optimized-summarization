            "text": "Cloud computing is a utility-driven, based on \"pay as you use,\" technology for remotely sharing the information technology resources rather than having local servers or personal devices handle applications [1][2][3][4][5][6]. Cloud computing is developing as a paradigm that aims to deliver dependable, personalized, with guaranteed quality of service, computation environment for the cloud clients. In cloud computing, and from the end user perspective, ITrelated skills are provided as services, accessible without requiring in-depth knowledge of the underlying technologies, and with a nominal management effort. The term cloud refers to the storing of data anywhere and accessing it anytime. The stored data can be obtained by users who have adequate and required permissions. There are many characteristics associated with the cloud, as defined in [7]. Cloud computing supports four delivery models: public cloud, private cloud, community cloud, and hybrid cloud [8][9][10][11][12].\n\u2022 The public cloud can be used for data that is not extremely sensitive and where the integrity of the data is subject to frequent changes. \u2022 The private cloud can be used for data that is highly confidential and is made available only to a small number of users. \u2022 A community cloud is a form of the public cloud where several customers share the same infrastructure with a community formed from other entities that share the same interest. \u2022 The hybrid cloud is a combination of two or more clouds; they also apply to clients who want to keep their most critical data on-premise and deploy their essential data on the cloud. It can be private, community, or public but are bound together by standardized technology. The hybrid cloud offers enhanced security at a lower price but could end up with high management complexity [13]. Cloud computing integrates different technologies and strategies to protect clients' data. The cloud service providers compete on using the latest security schemes. Nonetheless, there are still many ambiguities, security-wise, that are making many companies skeptical from fully embracing the cloud realm [14]. In cloud computing safety, security and privacy of data are essential metrics which build the trust level of the clients. Cloud computing is vastly used in different domains (e.g., social, economic, industries, financial institutions, government offices, educational institutions). Thus, individuals store their confidential data through cloud computing. Hence, before adopting the design and development of cloud computing, security requirements and privacy should be thoroughly investigated. Many companies, as well as individuals, are still skeptical about cloud computing when considering the security vulnerabilities associated with it. There are still no specified privacy and security protection laws explicitly created for cloud computing [15][16]. Many researchers are focusing on identifying the security and privacy issues which can be faced by cloud computing clients. Another area of research explores how to select trustable and suitable cloud providers to minimize security and privacy risks. To handle security issues, particularly privacy issues, the concept of TPA is introduced. The TPA has the expertise and the capabilities that the CC's and CSP's do not possess. The TPA is trusted to assess the CSP's storage security upon request from both the CC and the CSP, so the data is immune from Byzantine failures, malicious data, data modification attack, and even server colluding attacks.\nThe main contributions of this comparison analysis paper could be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 The state-of-the-art on privacy-preserving paradigms for cloud computing based on a TPA is discussed.\n\u2022 The CSP's vulnerabilities that provide a platform for a malicious TPA to use and generate the threats for data privacy are discussed. \u2022 Simulations experiment on the four most eminent PPM compared to our previously introduced LAPP.\nThe remainder of the paper is summarized as follows:\nSection II discusses the cloud vulnerabilities. Section III presents TPA's comparison of security factors. Section IV discusses the simulation parameters and results. And Section V concludes the entire paper.",

Considering the benefits of cloud computing, various organizations leaning towards cloud-based IT solutions. However, before starting the journey to the cloud, adopters must consider the possible vulnerabilities depicted in Figure-1that may convert their dreams of enhancing scalability and saving management cost into a nightmare of either data loss and misuse [17]. Hence, users must consider the risks involved with cloud adoption. The cloud experiences the vulnerabilities ( e.g., lack of trust, loss of control). As, these vulnerabilities greatly affect several security requirements such as privacy, authentication, authorization, accountability, privacy, confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, access control, and availability. Based on these vulnerabilities, different types of threats are possible such as re-entry, intoxication, Byzantine, colluding, discrimination threats.",

It is called a Collusive malicious feedback attack [18]. It consists of three types:\nSelf-Promoting: consists of promoting a Cloud service provider. Malicious cloud users enter significant positive feedback. Slandering: to defame a cloud service provider. Malicious cloud users enter Significant negative feedback.\nOccasional Collusion Feedback attack: in this case, the user occasionally enters significant positive or negative feedback. b) Intoxication Attack Malicious users behave alternatively in ethical or bad fashions [19]. In other words, the user first acts normal, but as time progresses, the user starts to misbehave after earning trust. These types of users are difficult to identify. This vulnerability is also called the dynamic personality of peers in the p2p network system. Uses a Forgetting factor technique to resolve this problem.",

Then the group who offered contradictory results might be labeled as dishonest. To date, there is no practical solution to mitigate such an attack.\nd) Reentry threat It consists of the case when the user who previously produced bad behavior reenters with a new identity to attack again [19]. It is called newcomer or reentry Attack. By comparing credential recodes using location, unique id, we can reduce reentry Attacks. Based on our study, dynamic auditing factors are given as RSA based storage security supports dynamic operation and identifies misbehaving servers in the cloud. However, TPA has control of the private keys (which is deemed unsafe). Privacy Negotiation Mechanism protects against Byzantine failures by dynamic auditing and server colluding attacks. However, it does not guarantee the privacy of the user's data. Privacy-preserving public auditing is highly efficient for dynamic groups, but it consumes more time and bandwidth to achieve high error detection probability. Third party storage audit service protects the privacy of the data, and it has less communication cost. In some cases, due to dynamic operations, which tend to make the auditing protocol insecure.",

The TPA's role in cloud computing is to assure the auditing function on behalf of the client and to establish a secure connection for the sake of achieving the integrity of the data. Nonetheless, there are some issues mainly related to trust that could emerge from involving a TPA. Many research approaches addressing security using a TPA and proposing solutions have been elaborated.\nTo pursue this goal, we have studied the most recent TPAbased approaches, classified them based on their adopted security methods using mind-map; and recapitulated these methods based the security requirements. The comparison analysis starts with the vulnerabilities of the CC that are discussed and provide the different scenarios for the TPA to use and generate threats on the CC's data privacy. The study reveals the major impact brought in by the TPA's adoption in securing cloud computing. This option comes with its concerns, as adopting a solution with a TPA can come with trust concerns, extra overhead, security, and data manipulation breaches. The privacy-preserving models are classified and categorized, focusing only on the dynamicity of the TPA. Furthermore, the limitations of each privacy preserving model are extensively discussed, concluding with suggested recommendations for future improvement. Based on the comparison analysis, we recommend to researchers to plan and orient their efforts towards developing a more simplistic lightweight, and secure solution compared to our proposed method LAPP that should help alleviate the gap in the cloud users' decision compromise and to increase the trust in adopting a solution based on a TPA.",
