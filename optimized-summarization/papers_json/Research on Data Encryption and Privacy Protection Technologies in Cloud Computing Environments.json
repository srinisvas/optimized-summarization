According to the latest cybersecurity reports, the number of global cloud data breach incidents increased by 37% in 2023, with 78% of cases involving sensitive personal information. Analysis shows that unauthorized access is the most common threat, accounting for 45%. Additionally, man-in-the-middle attacks and data tampering have also risen, with increases of 23% and 18%, respectively. To gain deeper insights into these threats, this study surveyed 1,000 companies using cloud services. The results revealed that 62% of companies had experienced attempts at data breaches, with 29% resulting in actual data loss or leakage. Regarding privacy, the risks posed by user behavior analysis and data mining are significant [3]. The survey found that 89% of cloud service providers collect user behavior data, with 57% using this data for commercial purposes. Furthermore, 31% of users indicated that they are unaware of how their data is being utilized.",

The core encryption process of AES can be succinctly represented as follows: C = E(K, P)where C represents the ciphertext, K is the key, and P is the plaintext. The decryption process is correspondingly represented as:P = D(K, C)The study employs a 256-bit key, combined with the CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode to enhance security [4]. In CBC mode, the encryption and decryption processes can be expressed as:\nC i = E(K, P i \u2295 C i-1 ) P i = D(K, P i \u2295 C i-1 )\nwhere \u2295 denotes the XOR operation. Experimental results show that for 1GB of cloud storage data, AES-256-CBC exhibits excellent performance, achieving an encryption speed of 150MB/s and a decryption speed of 140MB/s. To further improve the efficiency of the algorithm, parallel processing techniques were innovatively introduced. By dividing large files into multiple data blocks and encrypting them simultaneously, the processing speed was significantly enhanced by approximately 40%. Figure 1 illustrates the performance of AES-256-CBC encryption and decryption under different data volumes. ",

The encryption process of RSA can be represented as follows:C = M e mod n where C is the ciphertext, M is the plaintext, e is the public key exponent, and n is the modulus. An experimental key length of 2048 bits was used to balance security and performance. The test results indicate that RSA performs well for small data (such as session keys), but its efficiency is lower when encrypting large amounts of data. For example, encrypting 1KB of data takes an average of 15 ms, while decryption requires 60 ms, as shown as Figure 2. To improve efficiency, a hybrid encryption strategy was employed: the session key is encrypted using RSA, and then the actual data is encrypted using AES with that session key [5]. This method significantly enhances overall encryption efficiency while ensuring security, especially when handling large-scale data. ",

The core encryption process of CP-ABE can be expressed as CT = Encrypt (PK, M, A), where CT is the ciphertext, PK is the public key, M is the plaintext, and A is the access structure. The experiments employed an access policy containing 10 attributes, with encryption and decryption times for a 1MB file recorded at 0.8 seconds and 0.6 seconds, respectively, as shown in Table I. To optimize efficiency, the research team innovatively introduced an attribute hierarchy, successfully reducing key management overhead by 30% through the combination of related attributes [7]. ABE has demonstrated exceptional capabilities for achieving fine-grained access control in practical applications, but it also introduces a significant computational burden. To address this challenge, the study proposes a hybrid strategy that combines ABE with traditional encryption methods, making it particularly suitable for large-scale data processing scenarios. This hybrid approach effectively optimizes overall system performance while ensuring a high level of security. The experimental results not only validate the practical value of ABE in cloud environments but also provide important references for cloud service providers in designing secure and efficient data access control mechanisms.

For unstructured data, such as text documents, a regex-based sensitive information identification and replacement algorithm is implemented. The test results show that, on a mixed dataset of 10GB, the data masking processing speed reaches 150MB/s, with an accuracy rate of 98.5%. To verify the effectiveness of the masking, information entropy analysis was conducted on the original and masked data [8].\nThe results indicate that the information entropy of the masked data decreased by about 40%, effectively reducing the risk of sensitive information leakage.",

For numerical queries, such as averages and sums, the Laplace mechanism adds noise, with the noise size determined by the sensitivity and privacy budget \u03b5. The probability density function of the Laplace mechanism is given by:\nf(x|\u00b5, b) = 1 2b exp(- |x -\u00b5| b )\nwhere b= \u03b5/\u0394f, \u0394f is the sensitivity, and \u03b5 is the privacy budget. For non-numerical queries, such as the most frequent items, the exponential mechanism is used for output selection. The probability distribution of the exponential mechanism is:\nPr[M(x) = r] \u221d exp \ufffd \u03f5u(x, r) 2\u2206 u \ufffd\nwhere u(x,r) is the utility function and \u0394u is its sensitivity. In practical applications, testing was conducted on a user behavior dataset containing 1 million records. When \u03b5 is set to 0.1, the average relative error of the query results is 3.2%, while the privacy protection effect is significant,as shown as Figure 4.

The verifier checks the equation gs\u2261T\u22c5y c modp to validate the proof. This protocol has been extended for application in attribute-based access control systems. The experiments were conducted in a simulated cloud storage system containing 10,000 users and 100 types of access policies [9].
