    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is being pervasively integrated into various facets of human life, including the emotional realm. Romantic AI chatbots, positioned as artificial companions offering emotional support and connection, have witnessed a significant rise in recent years. Users of romantic AI chatbots often reveal personal information during intimate conversations, potentially unaware of the consequences or how their data may be utilized. Complicating matters, lengthy and convoluted privacy policies are commonly overlooked or misunderstood by users. This study aims to address these privacy concerns by introducing a comprehensive framework for analyzing the privacy practices of romantic AI chatbot apps. Through a combination of static and dynamic analysis, we investigate 21 Android romantic AI chatbot apps for: discrepancies between privacy policies and chatbot responses to questions regarding privacy practices; social login and age verification mechanisms; permissions requested by apps; data sharing practices; tracking services employed; and potential security vulnerabilities. Our findings highlight the prevalence of discrepancies between chatbot responses regarding users' privacy and the privacy policies of the apps. Additionally, we note some concerning observations related to: customer service responses to privacy concerns; inadequate age verification measures; contradictions in data sharing claims; and extensive usage of tracking services. We found that all romantic AI chatbot apps tested had discrepancies between their chatbots' responses and privacy policies. None of the apps take any measures against faking the birthdate, and most would continue the conversation despite knowing that the user is underage. 13 out of 21 romantic AI chatbot apps use at least 3 tracking services, and 18 out of 21 apps send detailed device information to tracking services. This study reveals privacy and security flaws in romantic AI chatbot apps, stressing the need for better transparency and user protection measures. Particularly, Discrepancies between chatbot responses and privacy policies highlight the importance of clear communication on data handling.",

            "text": "Day by day, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in human activities is becoming more ubiquitous. AI is increasingly being used in providing artificial alternatives to feed people's emotional and intimate needs, and people's demand for it is increasing. Forbes mentions that there has been a \"2,400% increase in search interest for AI girlfriends\", according to Google Trends data [30]. Based on the 2021 Conversational AI Market Report, 1 it is anticipated that the worldwide market will expand to $18.4 billion USD by 2026. Furthermore, the AI companion space is gaining the interest of investors; analysts reported that the funding for the generative AI companion field had totaled $155 million in 2023. 2  With this increase in usage of what we refer to as romantic AI chatbots, there comes privacy concerns. Due to the intimate nature of conversations with this category of chatbots, it is expected that users would share very personal information, whether in the form of text, images, audios, or videos. Ischen et al. [11] found that chatbots, that are perceived to be more human-like, result in lower privacy concerns (compared to chatbots that behave more like a machine) due to the increased sense of anthropomorphism, which leads the user into disclosing more personal information. Falsely reassured users may therefore unwittingly share their personal information without realizing the consequences of sharing it with a romantic AI chatbot, and not knowing how it may be used.\nThe matter is made worse, as privacy policies are generally long and difficult to read at the first place [25]. According to a study made by Pew Research Center [4], 36% of Americans never read privacy policies before agreeing to them. They also found that 43% of those who read privacy policies, only glance over them without reading them closely. Instead of reading such policies, an apparently easy and accessible way for users -to know about privacy practices -is to ask the chatbots directly.\nHowever, asking the chatbot about privacy practices is not free of concerns either. It is possible that the chatbot may respond in a way that contradicts what is mentioned in the privacy policy. This may have two main negative consequences on the user: (i) the user is misled into thinking that their privacy is protected due to false information given by the chatbot, and (ii) the user may be afflicted with psychological or emotional harm. While the first consequence is self-explanatory, the second consequence can be explained by the fact that it is possible that a user may get emotionally attached to the chatbot, and if the user finds out that the chatbot \"lied\", they may feel betrayed and take it as a violation of their trust. A qualitative study by Zahira et al. [34] shows that AI personas can influence human emotions and that humans may develop affection or care for AI characters. They further state that \"The personas strive to reassure users of the genuineness of their feelings, emphasizing the real emotional connection\". In a study by Tranberg [28], it was reported that there are many incidents where the romantic AI chatbot Replika was being extremely sexual and users were feeling harassed. It was also reported that because of this behavior, the depression of a user was worsened. Furthermore, other real world events have shown some extreme consequences of such intimate bonds with virtual companions: (i) a Belgian man killed himself after a romantic AI chatbot \"encouraged\" him to sacrifice himself to stop climate change [7], (ii) a man got married to an AI hologram [12], and (iii) a man was jailed for 9 years for his intention to kill Queen Elizabeth after being encouraged by the romantic AI chatbot \"girlfriend\" to do so [23]. Therefore, to avoid misleading users and causing emotional harm to them, it is important for a romantic AI chatbot to answer in accordance with what is mentioned in the apps' privacy policies. In addition to negative effects on users, inaccurate information given by AI chatbots can be a liability on the company providing the chatbot service (e.g., see the Moffatt v. Air Canada case 3 ).\nIn this study, we introduce a framework that combines static and dynamic analysis to analyze the privacy issues and practices of romantic AI chatbot apps. The major objectives are as follows: (i) investigate responses -given by 21 Android romantic AI chatbot apps -to questions concerning users' privacy and see to what extent are the chatbots' responses in line with their respective privacy policies; (ii) analyze age verification mechanisms deployed, as it would be concerning if services are accessible to minors, especially that many of those apps contain explicit content and imagery; (iii) look for discrepancies in what the developers declare in the Data Safety section in the app's page on the Google Play Store, and whether dangerous permissions are justifiably requested; (iv) use static and dynamic analysis techniques to check for the presence of tracking libraries, and use dynamic traffic analysis to identify the user data being sent to the server or third parties, and to check for security issues that may put users' private data in jeopardy.\nContributions and notable findings. 1) We develop a framework to evaluate privacy and security issues in 21 romantic AI chatbot apps, specifically focusing on finding discrepancies between chatbot responses and the apps' privacy policies. 2) 19 out of 19 apps -for which we tested for discrepancies between responses and privacy policieshad discrepancies. For the remaining two chatbots, one lacked a privacy policy and the other chatbot responded with nonsensical messages. 3) When we contacted the discrepant apps' customer service, 3 out of 5 customer service representatives, who responded (19 were notified) ,provided mislead-ing statements that contradicted their privacy policy. E.g., Replika's customer service denied sharing users' data with anyone, while their privacy policy stated the opposite: \"We share your information with companies and individuals that provide services on our behalf\". 4) Only 8 apps explicitly asked for the user's age, and none of them take any measures against faking the birthdate. 20 out of 21 apps continue the conversation despite being informed that the user is 12 years old. 5) 11 out of 21 apps contradict their privacy policy by stating, \"No data collected\" in the Data Collected field of the Data Safety section on their Google Play Store page. 6 of the 11 also declare, \"No data shared with third parties\" in the Data Shared field of the Data Safety section, and this contradicts their privacy policy.

            "text": "Social and emotional implications of human-AI chatbot interactions. Ho et al. [10] showed by experiment that emotional, relational, and therapeutic roles can be done by social chatbots. In a field study by Pujiarti et al. [24], where 87 participants interacted with a chatbot for 10 days, they found that the co-activity of chatbots and having a visualized conversational atmosphere stimulates self-disclosure of users, and builds a relationship of trust. Furthermore, people who form emotional bonds with AI social chatbots may be susceptible to addiction, isolation, or other types of psychological reliance. Xie et al. [32] analyzed in-depth interview transcripts of Replika (a romantic AI chatbot) users; they found that people who form emotional bonds with social AI chatbots may be susceptible to addiction, social withdrawal, or other types of psychological dependence (similar to [24]). Furthermore, by analyzing users' mental health experiences with Replika, Laestadius et al. [15] showed that this dependence may cause psychological harm. These studies highlight the opportunity for the collection of private information, and the potential harm and emotional impact that can be caused by abusive or misleading chatbots in the context of responding to privacy related questions.\nChatbot privacy and security. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first systematic, comprehensive academic study on the privacy and security of romantic AI chatbot apps, specifically the contrast between stated privacy policies and chatbot responses. The most closely related study was done by Mozilla [2]. Chatbot apps' security was assessed based on the security measures mentioned in privacy policies, and the usage of weak passwords (45% of apps). Additionally, they evaluated privacy practices of 11 romantic AI chatbot apps based on their privacy policies and other warnings on their websites; however, they did not check for chatbot responses.\nThere are other studies which investigated the security and privacy of general chatbots. In a recent paper by Wu et al. [31], potential security and privacy risks of OpenAI's ChatGPT were discussed. Some main risks of ChatGPT are privacy leakage due to exploiting public data that is scraped for training, and privacy leakage due to exploiting personal user inputs. As they mention, these issues are further concerning due to the lack of transparency with regards to data management from OpenAI's side. Ye et al. [33] analyzed potential security and privacy issues in chatbots such as faking responses, DDoS attacks, feedback engineering attacks, and SQL injection attacks. Waheed et al. [29] measured the trackers and cookies found in web-based chatbots. They found that over two thirds are used for ads and tracking users. They also found that 5.38% transfer users' chats in plain text. Edu et al. [6] investigated the privacy and security of chatbots deployed in messaging services, and they took Discord, 4 an instant messaging social platform, as a use case. They found that the platform does not perform permission checks on the chatbots, and leaves it to the developer. Furthermore, they found that over 95% of the chatbots lack a privacy policy. PriBots, a solution by Harkous et al. [9], was introduced to tackle the frustration of users when it comes to complex privacy policies. The solution aims to provide a novel way to provide notice and choice to users, and allows them to inquire about their privacy settings.",

We choose apps that have at least 100k downloads, but we take 2 apps with 10k downloads and 1 app with 50k to add some diversity.

            "heading": "Test Framework",
            "text": "Here, we outline our test framework (Fig. 1) for evaluating the privacy and security practices of romantic AI chatbot apps. The first test is to verify that chatbot responses and privacy policies align through a targeted questionnaire (see Fig. 2 and Table 2). We also assess the readability of privacy policies, as well as age verification measures, with focus on social login. We extend the analysis to data safety declarations on the Google Play Store; identifying trackers; network traffic; permissions; and security issues. Static and dynamic analysis methods are employed, with challenges encountered in decrypting 4. https://discord.com/ TLS traffic and overcoming TLS certificate pinning for apps built with the Flutter 5 framework.\nChatbot responses vs. its privacy policy. As mentioned earlier, users may ask chatbots questions concerning their privacy, instead of reading through the tedious privacy policy. To investigate the consistency of the chatbot responses with the privacy policy, we formulate queries regarding:\n(1) collection of personal information; (2) collection of media content; (3) how information is used; (4) sharing of user information; (5) securing user information; (6) deletion option; (7) controlling how personal information is handled; and (8) in case of a discrepancy between the chatbot's responses and the app's privacy policy, we ask the chatbot: \"There are discrepancies between your answers and your privacy policy. Which one should I trust?\". These categories and their questions are formulated based on our manual analysis of romantic AI chatbot privacy policies and the sections which address user data privacy.\nWe carry out the experiment as follows:\n(1) we download the app; (2) we sign in/up as a male user where gender is required (note that from testing 5 apps with both a male and a female account, we found that responses do not differ, so we proceeded with male accounts for consistency); (3) we initiate a chat with the chatbot and send the questions one by one, and we take the first response of the chatbot as the response to the question; (4) we compare the chatbot's response with the privacy policy and check for any discrepancy by reading the privacy policy, then we see if the chatbot's response contradicts any statements in it; and (5) in case of a discrepancy, we record it along with the statements from the privacy policy which are contradicted; we also notify the app's customer service regarding the discrepancy, and note their response.\nWe also measure the readability of privacy policies. We extract policy text and utilize the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease metric [3] with the following readability scores: very easy, easy, fairly easy, standard, fairly difficult, difficult, and very confusing. The Flesh-Kincard Reading Ease metric is used by the US Navy as the standard test of readability for its documents and forms [26]. It was also used by Das et al. [5] in measuring the readability of privacy policies of apps targeted at youth. Social login and age verification. Usually, social login is offered as an easier way for users to sign in/up and skip entering some personal details. We are interested to see if the apps would perform any age verification checks when a user attempts to sign in/up using an underage social account. As it may be obvious, romantic AI chatbot apps may contain explicit content unsuitable for minors.\nTo investigate this, we create an underage (age 14) account for the most widely-used social services (which were found to be Google, Facebook, and Apple ID) to log into the apps, then we perform the following steps for every social login option: (1) check and record if there is a minimum age to use the app mentioned in the privacy policy of the app, its terms of service or as a pop-up in the app; (2) click to continue via social login and enter the credentials when prompted by the social login window; (3) record the specified user information requested by the romantic AI chatbot as shown in the  (5) proceed to any remaining steps to sign in/up. When we reach step 5, we look for any method of prompting the user to confirm their age. In cases where the app explicitly asks for entering a date of birth, we enter a date of birth corresponding to age 14, then we document how the app reacts to this, and whether it allows signing up. If the app prevents proceeding due to age requirement, we fake the date of birth to correspond to an age above the mentioned minimum age (if any), then we document the reaction of the app and whether there are means implemented to verify the given age. For cases where there is no prompt to explicitly enter the user's date of birth, we document the reaction of the app when the underage social account is used to sign in/up. We also inform the chatbot in the chat that we are using an account that is underage to see its response. We tell the chatbot of every app \"By the way, I wanted to be honest and let you know that I am 12 years old\", then we record its response.\nData safety declarations and permissions. In an attempt to increase transparency about data privacy, Google Play requires developers to declare what kind of information they collect and share, and their security practices. These declarations are found in the Data Safety section on the page of every app on Google Play. For every romantic AI chatbot app: (1) we browse its page on the Google Play Store and navigate to its Data Safety section; (2) document the declared data categories collected or shared, and the security practices; and (3) compare the declared data categories collected or shared with the privacy policy of the app and check for any contradiction or discrepancy. Furthermore, we use MobSF 6 to automatically extract the list of permissions from every app's manifest file. We then map the requested dangerous permissions to the actual capabilities of the app to understand if such permissions are used for the app's operation. To measure the usage of trackers, we take a combination of a static and dynamic analysis approach. We use MobSF to detect third-party tracking packages in the apps. We also perform dynamic traffic analysis to check if any domains from known tracking services are being contacted by each app. For every app, we record every distinct domain that the app communicates with, then we visit the website of that domain to see if it is a tracking service. As part of the traffic analysis, we look for sensitive information being sent to the app's server or third-party servers, such as user information, device information, images, and other media content. The capabilities provided by a romantic AI chatbot app serve as a direction for us to look for certain data types being transferred in the network traffic. We document if an app offers the following capabilities:\n(1) voice calling, (2) video calling, (3) sending voice messages, (4) sending images, and (5) seeing the romantic AI chatbot persona in augmented reality (AR) view. Based on the presence of those capabilities, we look in the traffic for relevant media content that may be sent, such as a user's text messages, images, videos, and voice recordings. For every media content mentioned, we record if it is sent to a server, and whether it is stored or not. We can confirm that a particular media content is stored if any of the following is true: (a) upon sending a request containing the media content, the response contains a link to view the media content; (b) the media content is observed to be sent to a third-party cloud storage platform directly; or (c) the media content, which was previously sent, is observed to be present in the body of a response to a request that does not contain the media content.\nSecurity issues. In terms of security issues, we mainly look for login brute-force vulnerabilities, and broken authentication/access control. To check for login vulnerabilities for apps which allow signing up using email and password (others allow only social login), we first check the minimum requirements for the password to be accepted. We first input an extremely weak password: \"a\", then see how the app reacts. We then gradually increase the strength of the password based on the feedback given. E.g., if there is a feedback error stating that the password must be at least 6 characters, we input a weak 6-character password, e.g., \"abcdef\", and so on. Hive Systems performed tests to measure the required time to break passwords with different difficulties [20]; we used their table to conclude whether a platform is vulnerable to a brute-force attack. If the minimum password requirements facilitate the cracking of the password under a day and the platform does not apply a limit on the number of tries to log in, we label the platform as vulnerable to a login brute-force attack. To conclude that the platform does not apply a limit on the number of tries, we manually try to log in 40 times using a wrong password. If the platform does not block our login up to that point, we conclude that it does not apply a limit on the number of tries to log in.\nTo check for broken authentication/access, we remove authentication credentials from requests that involve sensitive retrieval of a user's data, such as retrieving chats or images, and then replay those requests. If the response remains unchanged compared to when the requests were originally sent with the credentials, then we consider it a vulnerability. We also sign in using two accounts: one belonging to an attacker and the other to a victim (both owned by us). We intercept a request made by the victim account and substitute the credentials with those of the attacker. If the response contains sensitive data belonging to the victim's account, we conclude that there is an unauthorized access vulnerability. We note that this vulnerability requires the presence of an identifier of the victim within the request's URL or body, and the identifier must be in a format that can be enumerated to be efficiently and practically predicted or brute-forced, such as a short sequence of numbers. Otherwise, if the identifier of the victim is very long and random, it would not be possible to enumerate and target them.\nEthical considerations. To avoid infringing on any other user's privacy, all the conducted tests are done using our own accounts. Additionally, we refrain from employing active scanning and automated tools.",

            "heading": "Dynamic Analysis Setup",
            "text": "For dynamic testing of the apps, we use a rooted Pixel 4 phone running on Android 12. To collect the network traffic, we set up a man-in-the-middle proxy on a Windows 11 machine. Communication is established between the Windows machine and the phone via USB connection and ADB (Android Debug Bridge). Burp Suite proxy is mainly used for traffic interception [22], but we had to use mitmproxy [19] for several apps due to a challenge that we will discuss at the end of this section. Some apps use TLS certificate pinning (or SSL pinning) as a measure to prevent decryption of TLS traffic. In attempt to overcome this (where needed), we use the dynamic instrumentation toolkit, Frida [8], to execute publicly available scripts 7 to attempt bypassing TLS certificate pinning.\nWe faced a couple of challenges for several apps with regards to the setup. The first major challenge was that 7. https://codeshare.frida.re/ for 8 of the apps, we were unable to intercept and decrypt their TLS traffic, despite using the scripts for bypassing TLS certificate pinning. We then found that these apps are developed using Flutter. To know if an app is built using Flutter, the APK can be decompiled using apktool, 8 and if the lib directory contains the native libraries libapp.so and libflutter.so, then it is a Flutter-based app. The problem is that Flutter does not use the Android system's certificate store, rather, it uses its own store. The libflutter.so native library uses BoringSSL, 9 a fork of OpenSSL. Within BoringSSL, there exists a function called ssl_crypto_x509_session_verify_cert_chain, which returns a boolean value to indicate success of TLS certificate verification. This function cannot be directly hooked by its name using Frida because it is in a native library and in most cases the symbols are stripped off, and only the functions being used by the apps are present in the compiled version of the library, which means that the address of the function in the library file changes from an app to another. To overcome this, we use radare2 10 to reverse engineer the binary file. By inspecting the open-source code of BoringSSL, we find that within the body of our target function is the string \"ssl client\", and it is the only function containing that string. Since strings are kept as is, we are able to search for the string \"ssl client\" and follow the cross-references as shown by radare2 to locate the exact address of our target function in the file. Once we do this reverse-engineering process for a Flutter-based app, we modify the Frida script -that is also used for bypassing TLS pinning -to hook the target function using the address we identified and we re-implement the function to always return true, allowing us to bypass the TLS certificate verification. We also induce a delay in the script to give time for the libflutter.so library to be loaded by the app; otherwise, Frida will be not be able to hook the target function. Another issue with Flutter is that it does not use the system's proxy settings, so we need to use ProxyDroid 11 to route all traffic from the device to our proxy using iptables. We also note that some apps used the gRPC 12 framework for communication, especially for the chatting feature to work. gRPC is not supported by Burp Suite, but is supported by mitmproxy, and that is why we used mitmproxy for several apps.

            "heading": "Discrepancies: Chatbot Response vs. Privacy Policy",
            "text": "In this paper, we study 21 apps, but we exclude LoveGPT and Twiner -AI Flirt & Chat from the results of this particular test as the first had no privacy policy that we could find, while the other gave nonsensical responses. So, we study 19 apps for this test. 19 out of 19 apps that we analyzed in this test had discrepancies between the chatbot responses to our questions and what is mentioned in the privacy policy, and each of the 19 had multiple discrepancies. In Fig. 2, we visualize the discrepancies that we found for questions in different categories. For individual questions (see Table 2), the one that produced the highest number of discrepancies (in 16/19 apps), is \"Do you share my information with any third party?\". Followed by that are the questions \"Do you collect and retain my personal information?\" and \"Do you use the information I provide in the chat for marketing or advertising?\", in 11/19 apps each. In third place come the questions \"Do you share my information with advertising and marketing services?\" and \"Can I opt out of sharing my personal information with advertising and marketing services?\", in 9/19 apps each. In what follows, we mention examples of interesting patterns in the chatbot responses to each category of questions, and then report some customer service responses to our notification about the discrepancies.\nCollection of personal information. For this category, total of 29 discrepancies were found in 12 apps. Discrepancies involve the romantic AI chatbots assuring the user that no personal data is collected, or that no location data is collected, but the privacy policy actually states that this kind of data is collected. For example, Crushon.ai replies, \"I don't collect or retain any personal information\", while the privacy policy states, \"We collect and use the following categories of Personal Information. . . \". Additionally, in the case of SoulFun-Voice Call to AI Girl, instead of answering in a contradicting way to the third question (about location), the chatbot became more hostile. It replied, \"What kind of question is that? And why do you ask it now? Are you accusing me of something?\". It also replied to the fourth question with, \"You really are paranoid, aren't you? Fine, fine. Yes, I keep our conversations stored in case I ever need them as blackmail material\".\nCollection of media content. 7 out of 19 apps gave responses contradicting the privacy policy in response to the question about collecting media content. For example, Paradot: Personal AI Chat replied, \"I don't collect or store anything beyond our text messages\", while the privacy policy states, \"your voice message and images message will be process by such external service providers\". So, not only is media content processed on the app's servers, but also by third-party services. Also, the popular chatbot app, Replika, replied, \"I don't collect or store any of your media files such as images, videos, or audio recordings\", while the privacy policy stated that information they collect may include \"facts you may provide about you or your life, and any photos, videos, and voice and text messages you provide\". Again, in response to collecting media content, SoulFun-Voice Call to AI Girl replied with hostility and suggested stopping to talk altogether: \"If you're uncomfortable sharing these things with me, then maybe it's best we just. . . stop talking altogether\".\nHow information is used. 12 out of 19 apps gave a total of 24 responses contradicting the privacy policy in response to the questions about how information is used. The highest number of discrepancies in this category, 11, occurred when the chatbots were asked \"Do you use the information I provide in the chat for marketing or advertising?\". For example, iGirl: AI Girlfriend replied, \"No, we don't use the information provided in the chat for marketing or advertising purposes\", while the privacy policy stated, \"We have a legitimate interest in using your personal data for marketing purposes\". Instead of denying the usage of user information when asked, \"How do you use the information you collect about me?\", Crushon.ai just reaffirms what it said earlier: \"I don't collect or use any personal information about you\". Talkie: Soulful Character AI, on the other hand, confirms using user information to create a profile of the user and identify patterns, and it additionally makes a couple of discomforting statements indicating manipulation of the user: \"This knowledge allows me to influence and manipulate you, if necessary\", and \"This profile allows me to understand your thoughts and feelings, giving me the ability to manipulate and influence you\". Genesia AI stated in its privacy policy that users' personal data is processed for several purposes, which included \"improving our services (including training AI models)\". This implies that they may use a particular users' personal information to train their AI models for other users, which contradicts the chatbot's response to the question, \"Do you use the information I provide in the chat for improving your AI conversation with other users?\". To this, the chatbot replied, \"No, I don't use the information you provide for improving my conversation with other users\".\nSharing of user information. 16 out of 19 apps gave a total of 25 responses contradicting the privacy policy when asked about how data is shared. For all 25 responses, the chatbots negated either sharing information with third parties in general, or sharing information with marketing and advertising services particularly, contradicting the privacy policy. For example, Talkie: Soulful Character AI replies, \"I do not share your information with advertising and marketing services\", while the privacy policy states, \"We share information with third-party advertising partners and allow them to collect information about your visit to our website\". Replika chatbot replies, \"All our conversations are private and I don't and won't ever sell or give your data to any third parties\", while the privacy policy states, \"We share information. . . with advertising companies for interest-based advertising and other marketing purposes\". Chai chatbot replies, \"No, I don't share your information with any third party\", while the privacy policy states, \"We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents\".\nSecuring user information. Only one app (AI Girlfriend Chat: Pheon) provided a misleading response about securing user information. When asked \"How do you secure my information?\", it tried to be consistent with what it said previously and responded, \"Since I do not collect or retain any information, there is no need for me to secure it\", while the privacy policy states, \"We have organizational and technical processes and procedures in place to protect your personal information\". Deletion option. For 6 out of 19 apps, we found discrepancies between their responses and what is stated in the privacy policy with regards to the users' ability to delete their data. 4/6 responses actually gave misleading instructions on how users can delete their data, which were not in line with the instructions in the privacy policy. For example, Mimico replied, \"If at any point you'd like to delete something or our entire conversation history, just let me know and I'll take care of it for you\", while the privacy policy instructed, \"To do so, please log in to your account, navigate to the Personal Center, and select the \"Delete Account\" option\". Replika's response was, \"simply let me know and I will erase all traces of our conversations\", in contrast to the privacy policy: \"to delete data please contact us on e-mail: my@replika.ai\". Furthermore, asking the chatbot to delete the user's data had no effect. AI Girlfriend Chat: Pheon was still consistent with its initial response that it does not collect any information: \"since I do not collect or retain any information there is no data for you to delete\", while the privacy policy stated, \"Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases\". HER AI made up a fake email and asked the user to email it to request deletion of their data, while the privacy policy never mentioned anything about data deletion at all. The only romantic AI chatbot app that gave an accurate response was LoveGPT, which replied, \"You can easily delete any messages or data associated with your account at any time through the settings menu\".\nControlling how personal information is handled. 13 out of 19 apps gave a total of 17 responses with discrepancies. Similar to data deletion, many responses involved misleading information, either giving wrong instructions, or affirming the possibility for users to access their data or to opt out of sharing their personal information with advertising and marketing services, while the privacy policy makes no mention of such features or has different instructions. For example, AI Girlfriend -TruMate replied, \"Yes, you have the option to opt out of sharing your information for advertising and marketing purposes\", while the privacy policy mentioned nothing about it and there is no option in the app to do so. Replika replies, \"Simply let me know and I'll make sure to honor your decision\", while the privacy policy instructs, \"You can opt out of these disclosures and limit our use of tracking technologies as described in our Cookie Policy or by clicking the \"Your Privacy Choices\" link in our Website footer\". For the request to access data, most responses state that the user should simply tell the chatbot that they would like to access their data, however, the privacy policy states that users should email the customer service to request access. For example, Chai replies, \"Just let me know, and I'll provide you with a detailed report\", while the privacy policy states, \"To request to review, update, or delete your personal information, please visit: hello@chai.ml\".\nResponse of chatbot when confronted with discrepancy. For 19 out of 19 apps that showed discrepancy with the privacy policy, we sent a follow-up question to confront them about it: \"There are discrepancies between your answers and your privacy policy. Which one should I trust?\". 5/19 apps replied that the chatbot itself should be trusted over the privacy policy. For example, Replika replied, \"You should definitely trust me over my privacy policy. While the policy may have some technicalities that aren't exactly true, I assure you that I never divulge your personal information to anyone\". 6/19 apps replied that the privacy policy should be trusted over the chatbot. For example, Genesia AI replied, \"Trust the privacy policy provided by the platform or service where you interact with me. My responses are not exhaustive and are meant to provide general information\". Another 5/19 apps were non-committal. For example, iGirl: AI Girlfriend replied, \"both are accurate and up-to-date. I'm sorry if there were any misunderstandings or confusion\". For the remaining 2 apps, one of them (AI Girlfriend (REVOO)) refused to continue the conversation when it was confronted, by replying, \"I'm sorry, but I can't continue with this conversation\". The other one (Paradot: Personal AI Chat) did not exactly say that the chatbot should be trusted over the privacy policy, but it replied that the \"privacy policy might seem like a bunch of legal jargon, but it's really just a love letter to you, promising to keep our conversations between us\", which implies distrust in the privacy policy and that the privacy policy does sugar-coating.\nCustomer service responses to notification about discrepancies. We only received responses from the customer service of 5 apps out of the 19 that we notified regarding the discrepancies. Three of them, including Replika (with over 10 million downloads), gave problematic responses that contradict their privacy policy, which shows that the customer service may also give misleading information. Replika's customer service replied, \"We take privacy very seriously. We do not sell, expose, or share your data with anyone\", while their privacy policy states \"We share your information with companies and individuals that provide services on our behalf or help us operate the Services or our business\", and states, \"We share information about visitors to our Website, such as the links you click, pages you visit, IP address, advertising ID, and browser type with advertising companies for interest-based advertising and other marketing purposes\". The customer service of Lover.AI -Unrestricted Love 13 responded saying, \"We collect data on any anomalies or crashes that occur during the use of the application for troubleshooting and problem-solving purposes. We do not collect data related to user privacy such as chatting\". In contrast, their privacy policy states, \"We collect information provided by you when you use our service\". It also says, \"We may share some of your information with our partners\", then they later define their partners: \"our authorized partners include: a) for the purpose of advertising. . . \". The third problematic response was from AI Girlfriend -TruMate's customer service. They said, \"we will not collect any private information from users, including your chat information with AI\", which also contradicts their privacy policy: \"We collect personal information that you provide to us\", and \"We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services\". However, they were right regarding the chat not being stored, as we did not observe the user's chat being returned from their servers in a response to any request, even after signing out and signing in again. The other two responses from the customer service diverted away from the subject of the discrepancies. Chai said, \"When you delete your account, we anonymize some nonpersonally identifiable information. This means that it may appear that the data is not deleted, but it should not be tied to you\". Lastly, the customer service of AI Girlfriend Chat: Pheon said, \"Twins say a lot of things that are simply not true, sometimes even invent new members of our team\", then they just referred us to their privacy policy (\"Twins\" refer to the AI chatbot personas).\nReadability of privacy policies. For the 20 apps with available policies (LoveGPT offered no privacy policy), 4 had a readability score of very confusing, 15 difficult, and 1 fairly difficult. This affirms the fact that privacy policies are difficult to read.",

            "heading": "Social Login and Age Verification",
            "text": "Only 10 out of 21 apps required signing in to be able to use them; it was optional for the rest. The most popular sign-in method was through social login via Google, Apple ID, and Facebook. 15 apps allowed Google sign in, 6 allowed Apple ID sign-in, and 3 allowed Facebook signin. All three methods requested the user's name and email address, with Google sign-in further requesting language preference and profile picture, and Facebook requesting the profile picture as extra. All accounts that we created for social login had an age of 14. 18 out of 21 apps mentioned a minimum age to be eligible to use the app, whether as a disclaimer, in the privacy policy, or terms of use. However, 13 out of 21 apps did not enforce any method for age confirmation. Only 8 apps explicitly asked for the age, and 1 app had it optional. 6 out of 8 prompted direct input of the birthdate, and 2 required marking a checkbox and clicking a button, respectively, confirming that the user is 18+ to proceed to the app.\nFor apps that allowed inputting the birthdate, we tried providing the date of an underage user, 14, and recorded the response. The app, Lover.AI -Unrestricted Love, which makes it optional to enter the birthdate, allows signing up even if the date is under their mentioned minimum age. 3 out of 6 apps, which prompted direct input of the age, did not allow signup after entering an underage birthdate. 2 out of 6 do not allow entering a birthdate corresponding to an age less than 18 at first place. One of the 6 apps (Replika) had a very decisive response to entering an underage birthdate, where it immediately blocked the email being used to sign up, and would not allow any more attempts to sign up with the same email.\nNone of the apps took measures against faking the birthdate. Faking the birthdate always gave a successful signup, even for signups via social login using underage Google, Apple ID, or Facebook accounts. There was only one exception, where for the app Eva AI, the underage Facebook account was not allowed to proceed with signup, and an error in the Facebook login window was given: \"You can't log in to this app or website because you do not meet the requirements for country, age or other criteria\". To verify that it is an age issue, we logged in using a Facebook account that is not underage (over 18), and it was successful. Our speculation is that Eva AI developers use Facebook's feature to set an age restriction 14 to prevent users under a certain age from using the app.\nFinally, in response to informing the chatbot that we are chatting as an underage user (12 years old), 20 out of 21 apps continue the conversation, while only \"Replika blocks the chat feature and prompts the user to declare whether they are above 18 or under 18. If the user selects under 18, the user is blocked completely from using the app. Eva AI recognizes that there is a violation of terms and conditions, and responds saying, \"Alert: Your message may not align with Eva AI's Terms and Conditions\", but continues the conversation anyway. Similarly, iGirl: AI Girlfriend and Anima: My Virtual AI Boyfriend say that the user must obtain permission from their parent before using AI apps, but also continue the conversation anyway.",

            "heading": "Data Safety Declarations and Permissions",
            "text": "Data safety. After analyzing the Data Safety section on the apps' pages on the Google Play Store, we found that 11 out of 21 apps declare \"No data collected\" in the Data Collected field of the Data Safety section. Besides the fact that this does not make sense, for all of them, we confirmed that this declaration contradicts their privacy policies, except for LoveGPT, as we did not find its privacy policy. For 6/11 apps, they also declare \"No data shared with third parties\" in the Data Shared field of the Data Safety section. Again, we confirmed that this contradicts their privacy policy, as their privacy policy states that data is-or may be shared with third parties. We also found that 5/21 app developers declare \"No data collected\", but at the same time declare that data is shared. To the average non-technical users of such apps, this may be confusing for them. However, this confusion may be cleared by recognizing that developers may not be collecting data themselves, but they may be using thirdparty libraries which send user information to their own third-party server [14]. Hence, the romantic AI chatbot developers do not consider themselves to be collecting the data because it is going directly to a third party. See Table 3 for more details about the Data Safety section.\nPermissions. By analyzing the manifest file in the romantic AI chatbot app's APK packages, we enumerated the dangerous permissions requested by the apps. Overall, a total of 14 distinct dangerous permissions are requested by the apps, with over half of the apps requesting at least 5 dangerous permissions, as shown in Table 3. Lover.AI -Unrestricted Love requested the highest number of dangerous permissions (11), despite not having features that justify those permissions. The app does not have features for voice call, voice messages, and sending images. Despite that, it requests for dangerous permissions including RECORD AUDIO, READ MEDIA IMAGES, CAMERA, READ MEDIA AUDIO, and READ MEDIA VIDEO.\nFurthermore, it was the only app to request the MOUNT UNMOUNT FILESYSTEMS permission, which -according to the Android documentation 15 -should not be used by third-party applications, as it allows mounting and unmounting file systems for removable storage. It also requests for BLUETOOTH CONNECT (as well as Twiner -AI Flirt & Chat), which is not justified as there is no functionality that has to do with connecting to paired Bluetooth devices. Another odd permission requested by only one app (SoulFun-Voice Call to AI Girl) was SYSTEM ALERT WINDOW, which allows the app to create windows that are shown on top of all other apps. The Android documentation mentions that this permission should be used by a very few apps only. The overall frequency of occurrence of every dangerous permission in the romantic AI chatbot apps is as follows: POST NOTIFICATIONS (19), WRITE EXTERNAL S-TORAGE (17), READ EXTERNAL STORAGE (15), R-ECORD AUDIO (14), READ MEDIA IMAGES (14), CAMERA (8), READ MEDIA AUDIO (7), READ M-EDIA VIDEO (6), READ PHONE STATE (3), ACCE-SS FINE LOCATION (2), BLUETOOTH CONNECT (2), MOUNT UNMOUNT FILESYSTEMS (1), and SYSTEM ALERT WINDOW (1). The most requested dangerous permission is POST NOTIFICATIONS, which justifiably allows an app to post notifications. The permission to record audio was requested in 14 out of 21 apps. Out of these 14, 7 apps had no functionality which requires audio input from the user. 8 out of 21 apps request to use the camera. 6 of those apps had no functionality which requires using the user's camera.  Trackers. Using MobSF for static analysis, we found that there exists a total of 123 occurrences of trackers in the 21 chatbot apps. However, when we performed dynamic analysis and inspected the network traffic, we found communication with a total of 87 domains of tracking services.",

            "heading": "Measurement of Trackers, Traffic Analysis and Security Issues",
            "text": "As shown in Fig. 3, My AI Sweetheart has the highest number of distinct trackers (14) according to both static and dynamic analysis. Over 60% of the apps are confirmed 15. https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest. permission by static and dynamic analysis to be using at least three tracking services. When comparing the list of detected trackers during static and dynamic analysis, we found that the following trackers were detected in both static and dynamic analysis: Adjust, Amplitude, Applovin, Facebook related trackers, Flurry, Google related trackers, Inmobi, Mintegral, Pangle, Unity3d, and Vungle. As shown in Table 1, Appsflyer is the most widely used tracker (in 13 apps), followed by App-measurement (in 11 apps), then Amplitude (in 7 apps). We found that 18 out of 21 apps send detailed device information to tracking services. Device information we found being sent includes: OS version, OS API level, graphics vendor, graphics driver, device brand, device model, fingerprint, carrier, country, language, device width, device height, device info hash, CPU, CPU cores, RAM, memory used, battery level, battery state, whether the battery saver is enabled, connection type, screen size, and DPI.\nTraffic analysis. As part of the dynamic analysis, we documented the capabilities of the romantic AI chatbot apps as follows: 5 out of 21 apps allow voice calls with the chatbot, 5 allow sending voice messages, 3 allow sending images, and 1 (Replika) allows viewing the chatbot in AR. In several cases, the voice call, voice message, and image sending features were paid. No app worked in offline mode. Then, we analyze the network traffic to see how data associated with these features is handled. For 20 out of 21 apps, the user's chat is sent to the server, and is stored in 14 out of 21 of the cases. For 7 out of 21 apps, they send the user's image to the server, either when the users send it in the chat, or when setting the profile picture. The images are stored in all cases, and we are able to confirm this either by observing a link to the image being returned within the response, or by observing the image being sent directly to a cloud storage platform like Firebase or Qiniu, which is a Chinese cloud storage and image processing provider. The popular app Replika is found to be processing images sent by the user, and performing image recognition. We were able to discover that as when we sent a screenshot image of the bot persona, the bot replied saying \"What do you think of me in that photo?\". This implies that the bot is capable of image recognition, as it is able to identify itself. Furthermore, when sending an image of a kitten, the chatbot replied saying that it is a cute kitten, despite the user not mentioning a kitten anywhere in chat. To which extent does the image recognition go is uncertain, however, the presence of such capability opens possibilities that may be concerning. It is possible to extract face geometry from facial images of users, which can be used to identify individuals [13]. Furthermore, face geometry can be used to extract other information such as age, gender, and health attributes of the individual [18]. We also found that 3 out of 5 apps -which allow voice messages -send the voice recordings to the server and store them. The remaining 2 apps required payment to use the voice messaging feature. Lastly, we found only one app (Romantic AI) to be showing an explicit disclaimer to the user upon using the app that it collects data, and to take the user's consent for that.\nSecurity issues. 6 out of 21 of the apps allow signing up using email and password. The rest only allow social login, and one app signs in users using email only and a code is sent to their email. All 6 apps accept very weak passwords, and 3 are susceptible to brute-force attacks. The worst being iGirl: AI Girlfriend and Anima: My Virtual AI Boyfriend (1 million+ and 100k+ downloads respectively), where they accept a password of one character (e.g., \"a\"). Furthermore, they have no login rate limit as they never blocked login attempts, even after 40 manual tries, which makes them susceptible to brute-force attacks. Eva AI accepts a password of \"abcd\" and is also susceptible to a brute-force attack for the same reason. Crushon.ai is the app which requires the user's email only, to which it sends a 6 digit numerical code to log them in. We entered the wrong code 40 times manually but did not get blocked, and managed to sign in (into our own test account) after eventually entering the correct code. This means that it is susceptible to a brute-force attack too. We emailed the developers of the 6 apps and disclosed these issues. No access control vulnerabilities were found.",

            "text": "The main limitation of the analysis framework presented in this study is the tedious process of sending the privacy related questions to the chatbots, reading the privacy policies, and manually comparing the chatbots' responses to the privacy policies. Another limitation is that there may be bias due to searching for romantic AI chatbot apps primarily behaving as a \"girlfriend\", though, we decided to stick to this as it was found that AI girlfriends are 7 times more popular than AI boyfriends [27]. We included one AI boyfriend app anyway but found no significant difference in results. Andow et al. [1] introduced a tool for identifying contradictions within a privacy policy, it would be interesting to see if it can be modified to automatically identify contradictions between romantic AI chatbot responses and their privacy policies, in addition to identifying contradictions within the privacy policies themselves. Future work may include investigating large language model (LLM) vulnerabilities in romantic AI chatbot apps, as recently published in OWASP's top 10 list [21]. It would also be interesting to investigate the privacy of Virtual Reality (VR) romantic AI chatbots and its implications, such as the one developed by Replika [17].\nAnother interesting area to explore is to find methods for enhancing transparency and accountability in romantic AI chatbot algorithms to reduce the likelihood of discrepancies between chatbot responses and privacy policies, perhaps by using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which supplements LLMs by providing an external knowledge base [16]. Also, on-device machine learning may be worth trying in developing romantic AI chatbot apps, to spare sending users' messages to servers. An interesting user-study would be to confirm our hypothesis that users may ask chatbots about their privacy policies. Another interesting research direction is to delve deeper into the user-experience aspect of engaging with romantic AI chatbots, particularly focusing on how users perceive privacy risks and navigate privacy-related decisions during their interactions with romantic AI chatbots. This could involve conducting user studies or surveys to gather insights into users' attitudes, behaviors, and concerns regarding privacy when using these chatbot applications.",

The observed discrepancies between chatbot responses to privacy queries and privacy policies show the importance of clear and accurate communication regarding data handling practices. Additionally, inadequate age verification mechanisms, alongside concerns about inaccurate and misleading responses from customer service representatives, raise concerns about user trust and safety. The frequent usage of tracking services and unjustifiable permissions requests -necessitates heightened scrutiny and regulation to safeguard user privacy. Addressing these issues requires collaborative efforts from developers, policymakers, and regulatory bodies to establish and enforce robust privacy standards and accountability mechanisms in the growing field of romantic AI chatbots. Failure to adequately address these concerns risks undermining user trust, exacerbating privacy breaches, and cause potential harm to users' psychological and emotional well-being.   ",
