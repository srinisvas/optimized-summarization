    "abstract": "Cloud Computing has been one of the most fascinating and influential technologies in recent years and has literally revolutionised the way we access computing resources by providing a virtually unlimited amount of resources instantaneously. Despite this seemingly amazing breakthrough, there are still some clouds on the horizon, preventing the paradigm from an even greater impact: While most technological issues are solved or nearly solved, two major areas still not only lack appropriate mitigations, but even a thorough understanding: Fear of privacy and security issues as well as a lack of control over own data remain the biggest obstacles towards a wider adoption of Cloud Computing. In this paper, we argue that existing solutions to protect users' privacy are not enough as they only focus on a single aspect at a time while being too complex. Instead, we present a novel concept called \"Software Defined Privacy\" which allows easy orchestration of existing tools to describe and enforce privacy requirements of an IaaS Cloud Customer.",

            "text": "The arrival of the Cloud Computing paradigm has nothing less than revolutionised the way data is stored, accessed and used for computation by providing instant access to virtually unlimited resources. Instead of using in-house hosted infrastructure, the cloud customer rents the required computation power or storage capacities provided be the Cloud Service Provider (CSP). This allows for more flexibility in both upand downscaling and is economically desirable as only the actually used resources need to be payed; unused hardware in local data centres becomes a relic of the past.\nThe most commonly agreed on definition of Cloud Computing defines five core characteristics [1]: On-demand selfservice, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity and measured service. Moreover, it defines three service models, namely Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) -with a focus put on the last-mentioned for this paper.\nWith the advent of this new paradigm, there also came doubts: Outsourcing potentially sensitive information to third parties not only means loosing control over what's happening to this data, but also requires a lot of trust to these third parties as a privacy breach -intentional or unintentionalcould have disastrous consequences. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that privacy and security issues are still perceived as the biggest challenges needed to overcome for the final success of Cloud Computing [2].\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section II will give a brief overview of various existing software defined systems and outline their benefits. Section III will introduce a number of existing privacy threatening issues in Cloud Computing and potential mitigation approaches. Our novel architecture called \"Software Defined Privacy\" will be introduced in section IV. Section V will then refer back to the introduced privacy threats and demonstrate how the framework will be able to counter these issues either on its own or by incorporating existing solutions. Finally, a conclusion will be given in section VI highlighting the importance of a unified privacy protection mechanism.",

            "text": "Software Defined Systems (SDSys) exist in numerous forms, like Software Defined Networks, Storage, Compute resources or combinations thereof, such as Software Defined Data Centres or Software Defined Clouds. While the technical implementation of each of those technologies might differ, they all share the same goal: To abstract from physical infrastructure and potentially different hardware vendors and present a single point of access and configuration to the user [3].\nUsually, this is done by decoupling components required for configuration (control plane) from those that are implementing the defined rules (data plane) providing a centralised configuration, but distributed enforcement. Besides the easier configuration, this approach also provides easier scalability by allowing to scale-out instead of scale-up.\nWhile programmable networks aren't completely new, but have been considered and investigated before [4], only the advent of highly dynamic infrastructures like Cloud Computing has made equally flexible networks necessary and consequently led to a wider adoption of such technologies coined Software Defined Networking (SDN)\nBy itself, SDN is both beneficial and harmful for network security leading to the conclusion that it is \"not really\" secure at this stage [4], [5]. On the one hand, it allows for easier acquisition of network traffic samples to analyse and also enables users to implement required changes faster. On the other hand, however, it also makes networks more vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) attacks by providing a single target.\nRecently, more security-focused approaches like Software Defined Perimeter or Software Defined Security have been presented [6]. Software Defined Security utilises the previously mentioned decoupling of various layers to define security policies which are then enforced by SDSec switches, which either forward or drop matching packets.",

            "text": "One of the biggest concerns in Cloud Computing arises from the multi-tenancy nature, where multiple, potentially competing companies share the same physical infrastructure, sometimes with an imbalance of awareness of this fact. A variety of attacks exploiting these characteristics have been demonstrated over the years, ranging from the exploitation of bugs in the hypervisor to executing influence over other VMs in form of DoS attacks. Reviewing past research also shows, that simply hoping for the technology to evolve and \"become secure\" is utopian as there are always new attacks and bugs unveiled, which endanger the infrastructure [8], [9], [10].\nIn an ideal or na\u00efve world, this problem could be solved by exclusively assigning hardware to customers, which, however, would lead to a number of negative side effects and loss of the defining characteristics of Cloud Computing: Massively reduced flexibility as well as decreased utilisation of the physical infrastructure and thus eventually higher costs for both provider and customer.\nTo mitigate some of these negative impacts a compromise would be conceivable: Various authors have described models based on the Chinese Wall Security Policy to mitigate the aforementioned issues while keeping the typical cloud characteristics in place [11], [12]. Using such an approach, the cloud customer would be able to select his area of business to ensure that no other, directly competing company, would be placed on the same hardware and thus possibly be able to run attacks. While the customer still would be potential target for other attackers, it could be argued that they wouldn't have much interest in harming this customer as no direct competition between them exists.",

For large providers, these facilities are usually distributed around the globe to provide georedundancy, locations closer to the customer (and thus less latency) and to obey potentially differing law regulations. The last point is particularly interesting from a privacy point of view as some countries have stronger privacy regulations than others, which might consequently not qualify as a suitable location for providing services [13]. In light of the recent fall of the \"Safe Harbor\" agreement1 , this issue might become more prominent in the near future. By signing the \"Safe Harbor\" agreement, companies from the US could declare to obey to the stronger regulations in the EU and thus allowing companies from European countries to store and process data in their data centres located in America.",

In fact, until a few years ago, data leakage was mostly associated with corporate on-site networks with secret data leaving an employee's computer; either due to malicious attempts or due to malware that had infected the machine. Detecting such leaks was therefore mostly done at network perimeter devices.\nWith the increasing move into the cloud, defining these perimeters becomes increasingly difficult and routing all traffic from the cloud to local detection devices lacks both efficiency and dynamic. Detecting these forms of data breaches is necessary in order to prevent more information from being lost, but doing so automatically on the side of the CSP can by itself be an intrusion to the customer's privacy [14], [15].\nFirst steps towards protecting this privacy and providing Data Leak Detection as a Service (DLDaaS) have been made [16], [17]. Using such a framework would allow the CSP to help preventing leakage of sensitive information without himself violating the customer's privacy.",

Software Defined Privacy follows this approach by specifying the same three layers.\nOn the Infrastructure Layer, there are the various components within a typical Cloud Computing system, such as virtual machines, hypervisors, storage systems, networks or others. This is, where changes will be made to by above layers in order to comply with privacy policies.\nTo orchestrate and apply these changes, an agent-based approach is used on the Control Layer: Lightweight agents are specialised to do one particular task and can easily be deployed (or undeployed) on systems either temporarily or permanently to quickly reflect changes in policies. These agents can be placed on either of the above mentioned components and change configurations thereof or install additional software that might be required.\nOn the Application Layer, the user is required to define his privacy needs. This is currently done using a rudimentary user interface during the instance creation (see fig 2), where the user can select policies applicable to his needs (see below for details on the user interface). Using an XML-based interface, it is possible to attach other, more sophisticated interfaces or let specialised \"Privacy Officers\" design a suitable set of rules for a particular VM.\nFigure 1 depicts the proposed architecture with all Software Defined Privacy-specific components highlighted in red. The whole system is designed to be as little intrusive to existing infrastructures as possible and instead playing well with widely used software, such as OpenStack to ensure easy adoption.",

Instead, more often than not, they promote misconfiguration and thus less protected systems as systems tend to get too complicated and users become unable to cope with too many choices [19], [20].\nBuilding on these findings, we suggest a two-fold dialogue: On the first level, there is nothing more than a very limited number of options (aforementioned studies suggest three) to describe the overall sensitivity of a virtual machine, such as \"secret\"/\"sensitive\"/\"unprotected\" (in decreasing order of required protection). Based on the user's selection, appropriate defaults will be selected and correspondingly configured tools deployed. If the user then wishes to further define his needs in a more detailed way, this option will be given as well. The user is capable of either loosening the suggested mitigation methods or putting even more protection mechanisms in place.\nFigure 2 shows a simplified dialogue during instance creation, where the user has chosen the highest default category (\"secret\"), which has automatically disabled backups and set the requirement of exclusive cloud hosts. However, the user has decided to not be in need of any sort of Data Leak Detection -neither as a service nor locally on the VM.",

While the former provides better isolation, it also removes many of the typical benefits of Cloud Computing and thus leads to potentially higher costs -for both CSP and cloud customer.\nOn the technical side, however, both approaches are similar in application: The original scheduler of the cloud management software, in our case OpenStack, gets replaced by a PrivacyAwareDeploymentAgent. More specifically, the agents provides a thin wrapper around the original scheduler and adds some critical functionality.\nBefore deploying a virtual machine, the Agent checks for any privacy policies associated with the instance. Following that, it looks for available hypervisors that match the requirement. In the first case, this would be either completely empty hypervisors or hardware only occupied by the same customer whereas in the second scenario any hosts without competing customer machines are valid. Finally, the virtual machine gets deployed on one of the limited set of hypervisors by the original scheduling algorithm.",

All aforementioned verifications need also to take place, when instances are automatically moved (e.g. by the CSP to achieve better utilisation of the existing infrastructure). Moreover, the Agents must be capable of triggering a relocation by themselves: When the cloud customer removes a certain location from the list of allowed places while one of his instances resides there, this instance needs to be immediately transferred into a safe place",

In the scenario of complete denial, all incoming requests are blocked, so that neither the cloud customer can create backups/snapshots nor the cloud management software itself, e.g. when trying to automatically create regular backups.\nIn the first case, the ArchiveProtectionAgents requires the user to provide a public key. Using this key, the backup/snapshot is encrypted before being permanently stored on the provider's hardware.

Keeping configuration files in sync with the original intent becomes increasingly difficult as systems get more and more complex and distributed. Consequently, being able to detect misconfiguration early will allow to predict and prevent privacy breaches.\nLet's consider the example policy \"All web server traffic must be encrypted\" (i.e. transmitted via HTTPs). Ideally, the web server would enforce this by not listening on port 80 at all. In this example, however, the company has recently switched its web server software (e.g. from Apache to nginX) and during that transition a new configuration file had to be created -which is now responding on port 80 as well and thus presents a potential threat to the system's privacy.\nThis improper configuration is detected by a PrivacyBreach-PredictionAgent by parsing the configuration files in question and comparing them to the original privacy policy. A PrivacyBreachDetectionAgent will simultaneously analyse the web server's log files to determine if the privacy has already been breached or it is a theoretical leak to date. Finally, a PrivacyBreachResolvingAgent would give recommendations to fix the issue; in this case by changing the configuration file. Furthermore, last-mentioned agent is also capable of deploying temporary counter measurements, such as adding firewall rules to make the system comply with the intended policies.\nIn addition to user-defined policies, the Agents can optionally also verify compliance with existing best practises such as provided by the German Federal Office for Information Security for Apache web servers [21].",

Various examples in this paper have shown, how this enables the cloud customer to protect himself against against various attacks, such as Intra Host Attacks or transborder data flow.\nCompared to other solutions geared towards security improvements, our approach is less intertwined with the SDN approach, but only shares the principle of decoupling configuration and enforcing of policies.",
