            "text": "This paper focuses on cloud digital data loss and its privacy preserving by proposing a novel framework approach to mitigate the risk and protect the data from attackers. The high digital data storage center, user privacy maintenance is a wearisome chore for end-user and service provider. Unceremonious seclusion contracted with habitual user personal information, the main reason to develop and propose this novel framework for maneuver in sequence data progression and maturity. The current information dispensation conceded slightest relationship and input circumstances. Radical usages of cloud data irrespective of consign and contrivance may direct to violate user's privacy and their needs. [1][2][3][4][5] et al expresses the dominant usage of critical data and its preserving techniques are handled in an earlier data protection method. Virtual swarm is ensuing cohesion with provider and user. More informational confidentiality has personage precincts for user acquiescence and admittance to data exodus in storage area. This paper focuses the general privacy issue and its preserving methodologies adopted so for are not meeting the requirement of cloud user. The limitation of data attackers generally overcomes to preserve better utilization of authorized user data. [5], [7], [13] author et al uses a cookie based monitoring the user behavior, an identity based data storage and retrieval and a frame work to establish enough trust among user on providers. To illustrate the scientific structure for normal systems are not adequate more over a perfunctory approach for preserving confidential data. It is noted to be less cost effective process for implementing in many field whereever privacy is necessity. [6][7][8][9], The general behavior proposed in this approach experiments a better data utility option with improved privacy preserving technique. Once all information readily available online one can easily get into others storage without any risk and makes the data into risk and there is no information privacy in it. [18], [21], [26], and [28] a secure and efficient data retrieval by data using attribute based encryption, theoretical analysis of authentication and an novel architecture to preserve user privacy and authentication. If and only if no one else knows even something regarding your personal data, it may climb to be information privacy. Why the social networking providers need of user personal information, literally they are utilizing it for business and making confidential data into profit. [1][2][3][4] author et al proposed a privacy preserving approach for mitigating the security for user data using encryption and decryption technique, a Petri-net based framework approach to preserve user information, and an evolutionary model for protecting digital data. [6], [29][30][31] cloud service privacy representation to ensure the trust in cloud providers. An intelligent model based hybrid approach to preserve user digital content, pervasive and ubiquitous computing environment privacy preservation carried out, and a generic approach to molt the assurance of secrecy in maintain cloud digital data. [8][9][10][11][12], [22,23,25] author et al proposes a multi agent system to accommodate the software process and a framework to mitigate the issue. [10], author et al a SVIP based mechanism for SIP dependent system and its security measures are handled. [14][15][16][17], [19][20], author et al proposed a global replica management by ensuring and enhancing the QOS parameters, and an efficient service cache management for mobile peer to peer network. [24], [27] a testbed and an evaluation criteria for a distributed web service environment for the service suitability.",

Onion and garlic privacy preserving approach-OGPPA have a right to prevent the privacy of communication happening in cloud systems.
