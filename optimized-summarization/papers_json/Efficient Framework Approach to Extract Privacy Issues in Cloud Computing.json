    "abstract": "To overcome the challenges emerged in adoption of cloud computing technologies, many countries has conceived and designed data privacy and confidentiality protection regulations. The objective of this paper is to identify privacy issues and design a framework pertaining to privacy and confidentiality concerns in adopting cloud computing. It is imperative to note that privacy concern is increasingly important in the online world. The secure processing of personal data in the cloud is a huge challenge now a days. Such a framework and exploration can provide benefits to the all communities linked with cloud computing. It will help in better understanding of the privacy issues associated with cloud and will spark ideas and lead to further research on this subject whom may lead to the development of privacy regulations and/or the improvement of existing Regulations.",

            "text": "Cloud Computing is comparatively a new model in the IT world. It has-been defined by NIST, as the following: \"Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction\". Cloud computing has four deployment models. Those are: 1) Public Cloud: In public cloud infrastructure is made available to general public and is owned and managed by CSP.\n2) Private Cloud: In Private cloud, infrastructure is used by a single organization.\n3) Community Cloud: In community cloud service the cloud infrastructure is used by several organizations belongs to specific community that has shared concerns. 4) Hybrid Cloud: In Hybrid cloud, cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public).\nCloud computing has essentially five main characteristics shown in the diagram: Privacy is a key issue in cloud computing. In general, privacy is about the accountability of a cloud provider to customer, as well as the transparency to cloud provider's practice around personal data/information. Cloud computing is a rising technology in the field of Information Technology. Therefore, it is of preeminent importance to deal with issues and challenges of privacy. Offending and violation of privacy not only affects users but also cloud service provider because it maculates their credibility with customers. The concept of privacy varies widely among countries and jurisdictions.",
