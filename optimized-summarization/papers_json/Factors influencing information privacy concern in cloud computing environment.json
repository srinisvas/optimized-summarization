    "abstract": "Cloud computing technology is one of the newest technologies widely used by consumers globally due to its advantages. One of the common advantages is that users can get access to applications and their own files and data on demand. However, there are privacy concerns and issues which discourage users from being active in cloud computing. This paper attempts to investigate the factors that influence information privacy concern in cloud computing environment by using a quantitative research approach. A total of 340 cases were gathered from a sampled population of students. Based on SPSS analysis, the study found that perceived privacy risk is influencing information privacy concern in cloud computing environment. Meanwhile, perceived privacy control and perceived effectiveness of privacy policy have no significant impact on information privacy concern in cloud computing environment.",

            "text": "Cloud computing technology is a recent trend in the field of information and communication technology. It is defined by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as \"a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction\". This definition seems to be the most accepted and satisfied definition of cloud computing as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Criminal Justice Information Services department (CJIS) has agreed and acknowledged this definition as shown in their 2012 CJIS Cloud Computing Report [1]. It can be said that cloud computing technology is a kind of storing and accessing of applications and computer data often through a Web browser rather than running installed software on personal computer or office server [2].",

            "text": "Cloud computing technology offers various types of services and applications for the public and organizations. One of the most commonly used cloud computing services is social networking websites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram and many others, although these were not initially considered cloud computing services. Another example of cloud computing services is E-mail services. Other major example of cloud computing services is Google Drive. All of Google's services could be considered as cloud computing such as Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Reader, Google Voice, Google glass and so on. In addition, Apple's cloud service is primarily used for online storage and synchronization of user mail, contacts, calendar, and more. All the data you need is available to you on your iOS, Mac OS, or Windows device. Prior studies found that information privacy concerns is an essential factors that discourage and influence users from transiting through online channel [3].On the other hand, many issues have been raised in cloud computing environment, from the consumer's perspective. According to D. Chen & Zhao (2012) argued that information privacy and security concern in cloud computing are the main inhibitor for adopting and using cloud computing services [4]. Also, S, Daniel, & Vasanthi (2013) claimed that privacy concern is the major barriers in the growth and adoption of Cloud Computing by the IT industry and public consumers due to absence of any reliable and efficient privacy evaluation mechanism [5].\nTherefore, it is required to conduct an empirical investigation upon the factors that influence users' information privacy concern in cloud computing environment. As a result, it would give a clear view to cloud computing service providers regarding the gap that they have in their cloud services, which should be assessed and overcome.",

            "text": "In this study information privacy concern is a dependent variable which has been addressed by allocating four variables. Hence, in this study it is assumed that these variables are influencing information privacy concern in cloud computing environment. However, according to Oxford Dictionaries privacy means \"The state or condition of being free from being observed or disturbed by other people\". While, Mishra, Ranjita; Dash, Sanjit K (2011) indicated that privacy is the of transmitted data from passive attacks [7]. Another popular definition provided by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) in the Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP) standard is \"The rights and obligations of individuals and organizations with respect to the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personal information\". In other words, it is the matter which is related to the data collection, use, disclosure, storage, and destruction of personal data or personally identifiable information [4]. In addition, as cloud computing system usually offers services (e.g. DaaS, SaaS, IPMaaS, PaaS, and so on) on the other hand of the Internet in terms of its users, the secret information of individual users' and business' are stored and managed by the service providers in cloud, and consequently results in privacy concerns. In fact, privacy issues exist since a long time in the computing literature [4]. Nevertheless, most of the information system literatures researchers have addressed and approach the concept of information privacy concern as general concern which reflect users' natural worries and concerns upon the possibility of information privacy loss [8][9]; whereas, in this study the researcher is attempting to investigate and find out the factors that influences users' information privacy concern in cloud computing environment.",

            "text": "Cloud computing technology involves distributed computation on multiple large-scale data sets across a large number of computer nodes. Every Internet user is able to share his or her personal data to the Cloud Computer systems which are located on the other side of the Internet. For instance, a user's click stream across a set of webs (e.g., Amazon book store, Google search web pages, etc.) can be used to provide targeted advertising [10]. However, few studies tried to clarify the nature of control in the privacy context. For instance, in privacy literature, control has been utilized to refer to several objectives such as social power and procedural fairness of an organization's privacy [8]. Studies have specified perceived privacy control based on three dimensions: 1) knowledge: users should be aware of a service provider's information practices. It is assumed that without this knowledge, a consumer is unable to make a decision as to either disclose personal information or not. 2) Choice/access: users should be provided with choices as to how their personal information is utilized beyond the use for which the information was provided. 3) Use of privacy tools: when privacy tools like protocol for privacy preferences (P3P) or privacy seals are used by some service providers then the user begins to believe that his control over his personal information is growing [11] [12].\nTherefore, hypotheses1: Perceived privacy control will negatively influence consumers' information privacy concern in cloud computing environment [8].",

            "text": "Overall, risk has been defined as the uncertainty resulting from the potential for a negative outcome [13] and the possibility of another party's opportunistic behaviour that can result in losses for oneself [14]. Therefore, usually negative perceptions are related to risk and it may influence an individual emotionally, materially, and physically [15]. Previous studies agreed that since online service providers requesting users' personal information as a part of online transactions, the users express their concern about such information being misused, sold, disclosed, or exchanged with other parties without authorization from the owners [16]. It has been proved that such risk perceptions of online users constitute an obstacle to the widespread acceptance of online transactions mainly when sensitive information is required [17] [18]. There is thus a consensus among researchers that risk is vital factors in making any kind of online decisions [19]. According to S. Chen & Li (2010) unlike consumers in the physical market, consumers may be dealing with remote vendors that they have never met and products that cannot be touched and felt. Hence, consumers tend to be reluctant to conduct businesses based only on the information provided by e-commerce vendors because such information may not be reliable [20].\nTherefore, this study is trying to measure users' privacy risk and its impact on users' information privacy concern. Thus, hypotheses2: Perceived Privacy Risk will positively influence consumers' information privacy concern in cloud computing environment [8] [21] [11].",

            "text": "Privacy policies are notices that are displayed on an online service provider, accessible to the public, and describe an organization's information practices. In fact, privacy policy not always true in practice. Privacy policies are made to reflect a service provider's actual privacy practices and serve as a contract between the service provider and the users. The privacy policies and strategies that online service providers adopt, implement and communicate to users can have an impact on users' information privacy concern [22] [23].\nPrior studies found that perceived effectiveness of privacy policy is influencing users' information privacy concern. According to Milne and Culnan (2002) reported that privacy policy notices are an important means for reducing users' privacy concerns by providing users with information about the service providers' information practices [24]. Also, Shepard (2004) illustrated that roughly 60% of a sample of online service users said they decided not to use a website or not to purchase something from a web site because they were not sure about the collection and use of their personal information [25].\nTherefore, hypotheses3: Perceived effectiveness of privacy policy will negatively influence consumers' information privacy concern in cloud computing environment [26].\nIV. METHODOLOGY A quantitative survey method has been adopted to collect data from targeted respondents. For that, we conducted a selfadministered and online questionnaire to be answered by Undergraduate and Postgraduate students from the International Islamic University Malaysia. A total of 340 cases were usable. The survey items were adopted from prior studies where a five point-Likert scale was applied for each item.",

While perceived privacy risk, perceived privacy control and perceived effectiveness of privacy policy were entered as independent variable. The result of multiple regression provides two tables. The first table entitled ANOVA which illustrates the goodness of fit of the model, while the second table entitled Coefficients shows the significance of the independent variables (perceived privacy risk, perceived privacy control and perceived effectiveness of privacy policy) drivable to the dependent variable (Information Privacy concern). The result of ANOVA demonstrates that the model is significant at 99% because P value is less than 0.05, this result strongly validate and show the goodness of fit of the model. According to Gupta (1999) if Significance value is < .01, then the model is significant at 99%.\nHowever, the Coefficients table provides information about the effect of independents factors on the dependent variable and the confidence with which we can support the estimate for each such estimate. Moreover, it can be seen that there is a significant relation between perceived privacy risk and information privacy concern (p= .000, < 0.05), which means that P value is true at 95% level of confidence. In another word, the result shows that consumers with high degree of privacy risk in Cloud Computing Environment (CCE) have high degree of information privacy concern in CCE as well.\nTherefore, H2: \"Perceived Privacy Risk will positively affect consumers' information privacy concern in CCE\" is supported. While, perceived privacy control and perceived effectiveness of privacy policy have no significant relation with information privacy concern in CCE (perceived privacy control P = .210, perceived effectiveness privacy policy P = .396, > 0.05). This result indicates that perceived privacy control and perceived effectiveness of privacy policy does not influence individuals' information privacy concern in CCE. In another word, perceived privacy control and perceived effectiveness of privacy policy have no significant relation with information privacy concern.\nTherefore, H1: \"Perceived privacy control will negatively affect consumers' information privacy concern in CCE\" is not supported.\nAlso, H3: \"Perceived effectiveness of privacy policy will negatively affect consumers' information privacy concern in CCE\" is not supported.\nTo conclude, perceived privacy risk is influencing information privacy concern positively in CCE.

The outcome proves the prior studies [27] [25] where their investigations found that more than 98.6% of the consumers engaged and using social networking websites such as Facebook, Friendster, MySpace and Twitter.\nOn the other hand, this study found that perceived privacy risk is influencing information privacy concern in cloud computing environment statistically and significantly. Yet, In the same time the finding of Odeyinde (2013), Yuan, Shu, Yifeng, Tong, & Wei (2009) and Smith (2009) have found that there is positive relationship between privacy risk and privacy concern. In other words, when users have the feeling of privacy risk the concern of information privacy would be high [11][21] [29]. Whereas, this study found that perceived privacy control has significant impact on information privacy concern in CCE, but Xu et al. (2011) study showed that there is statistically and significantly negative relation between perceived privacy control and privacy concern [8]. The difference in the result might because of the difference in the targeted population whereby this study have been conducted on the population of International Islamic University, while, Xu et al's (2011) study have been conducted on three large universities in the southeastern and northeastern of United States of America. Moreover, the previous reason goes to the result of hypotheses three where perceived effectiveness of privacy policy has no significant relationship with information privacy concern, while Wu et als' (2012) study showed that privayc policy has negative influence on privacy concern and it was partially supported [26].",
