    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence into crosscloud data-sharing frameworks opens up completely new vistas for novelty in preserving privacy while at the same time increasing collaborative efficiencies. This project closely examines designing and implementing AI-generated protocols that protect sensitive data privacy exchanged between heterogeneous cloud environments. These would be the protocols using machine learning algorithms for runtime vulnerability and risk detection, dynamic flow encryption, and predefined privacy policies. This research would be based on leveraging federated learning and differential privacy techniques to ensure that the best way to optimize shared model accuracy is to follow all data protection regulation compliances. The empirical results indicate that the proposed protocol metrics outperform the state-of-the-art methods in maintaining data integrity, minimizing leakage risks, and enhancing data interoperability in a multi-cloud architecture. It contributes toward bettering secure collaboration processes across various verticals, including healthcare, finance, and telecommunications.

Cross-cloud architecture makes organizations more flexible, cost-effective, and resilient by leveraging the unique features of various cloud providers. Ensuring privacy and security becomes fundamental when data crosses these interrelated cloud environments. Cloud service providers' different security policies and protocols increase the risks of unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance violations. This is one more reason why it's getting so complex in organizations to maintain a secure but seamless and efficient process for sharing data across multiple clouds [1,2,3].",

For instance, the encryption techniques of AES and RSA are widely used for data protection at rest or during transmission. However, they create a lot of obstacles in cross-cloud scenarios owing to computational overheads and fundamental management complexities. More advanced approaches, like ABE, can enable flexible, role-based access control, reducing various risks against unauthorized access [8,9]. So far, notions such as homomorphic encryption have enabled computations over encrypted data without exposing their contents. While it is very promising in theory, because of the high computational costs, it is far from realistic for big deployments over the cloud. On the other hand, SMC enables joint processing without sharing raw information. At the same time, differential privacy investigates protection at an individual record level by adding noise at a statistical level. However, when applied in cross-cloud environments, most are plagued with interoperability problems and show complex issues while applying consistent privacy policies [10,11,12,13].",

For instance, machine learning models can go through vast volumes of information to identify the appearance of potential threats and anomalies in the flows, enriching real-time security monitoring. The most outstanding of all the AI-based methods is federated learning, which enables several parties to collaboratively work on model training without exposing the raw data. This opens up the possibilities for decentralized model training whereby only model updates must be shared, which has much lower associated privacy risks. Applications of federated learning can be perfectly realized in industries like health care that want co-modeling but with the guarantee of data confidentiality [14,15,16]. AI also empowers better data security because of differential privacy. In this respect, differential privacy injects controlled noise into the training process in AI for any single point of data to remain secure when model precision is preserved. Leading companies in AI-powered applications have used This approach to secure user data. Furthermore, reinforcement learning allows runtime dynamic encryption strategies to factor in contextual variables on data sensitivity and threat level for runtime optimization against security measures. Of course, this adapts an efficient approach that does not sacrifice robust security when reducing computational overhead [15,16].\nOnce applied in large-scale cross-cloud settings, the AI algorithms also automate key management; the mechanisms will reduce manual complexities. Automating the critical rotation/revocation processes may mitigate risks connected to key compromise or unauthorized access.",

            "text": "Due to heterogeneity, a significant challenge remains in securely sharing the data across cloud platforms. Each runs under a different security protocol and data governance framework that complicates uniform mechanisms of privacy implementation. Moreover, privacy risks and compliance issues arise while sharing data across heterogeneous clouds. Besides this, scalability and performance problems also arise from conventional methods. Solutions involving homomorphic encryption are computation-intensive and, hence, not practical for large-scale deployment. Another alternative is differential privacy, which consists of a trade-off between noise addition and data utility, thus degrading the accuracy of the shared data [17,18,19].\nAnother weakness the traditional encryption-based methods face is context awareness; data sensitivity may differ based on the user role or application context. Current protocols have mostly been static and cannot prepare for this type of variability in handling, thus resulting in underprotection or over-encryption. Another challenge is adherence to various regulatory frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation. Even supported by automated AIbased checks, achieving standardized privacy practices across these many jurisdictions can remain insurmountable. While the AI models themselves may significantly automate compliance, a need exists for standard frameworks to put any policy into practice uniformly [20,21].\nHowever, even secure cross-cloud sharing will not make the task easy on the reliability of the AI models. Reliability grows with the quality of the training data. Models must be refreshed to nullify false positives and omit open vulnerabilities in cloud environments characterized by dynamically changing re-emerging threats and data types. In addition to that, AI algorithms could also be susceptible to adversarial attacks, which are when a malicious actor tries to deliberately manipulate input in order, for instance, to trick a model into giving away privacy. Finally, the higher contribution of AI to privacy mechanisms engenders a great deal of trust and transparency issues: the decisions about access and encryption driven by AI have to be understandable with organizational security policies in place. Otherwise, the reduction in effectiveness because of trust problems is well expected for AI-driven solutions operating in multi-cloud environments [22,23].",

The module discussed here continuously monitors contextual parameters such as user roles, application usage, and geographic location and updates the security policies accordingly. It may mean varying levels of encryption, such as data transferred within a regulatorycompliant region versus across borders.\nFinally, the layer of Cross-Cloud Collaboration ensures data interoperability across cloud platforms for maintaining consistent application of protocols related to privacy among participating clouds. Due to these modules, we have a Secured Data Sharing layer, which allows protected data to be shared without violating privacy norms [18].",
