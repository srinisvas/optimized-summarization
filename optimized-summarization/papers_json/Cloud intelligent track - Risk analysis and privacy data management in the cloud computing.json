    "abstract": "Cloud computing is a computing platform with the backbone of internet to store, access the data and application which is in the cloud, not in the computer. The biggest issue which should be addressed in cloud computing are security and privacy. Outsourcing data to other companies worries internet clients to think about the privacy data. Most Enterprise executives hesitate to use cloud computing system due to their sensitive enterprise information. This paper provides data integrity and user privacy through cloud intelligent track system. This paper discuss about the previous experiment done on the privacy and data management. The work proposes the Architecture or system which provides intelligent track in Privacy Manager and Risk Manager to address privacy issues which rules the cloud environment.",

            "text": "Cloud computing is anywhere and everywhere. Lets pick up any technical magazine or visit almost any IT website or blog and we will be sure to see talk about cloud computing. A survey done in 2006 which says if a question posted to different professions as what is Cloud computing? The survey says that we get different answers from different professionals. Cloud computing gives practical cost benefits such as investment cost and operating cost and can transform a data from one environment to other priced environment. Still security plays a major part in Internet, when we are using it to send sensitive information between enterprise parties. Information Technology is blooming in the areas of mobile computing, pervasive computing or ubiquitous computing, and dominant cloud computing. Cloud Providers offer services that can be grouped as saas: software-as-a-service [2] [9], paas: platform-as-aservice and iaas: infrastructure-as-a-service. Now a day's most of the Enterprises deploy applications on Public, Private or Hybrid clouds. Public clouds are maintained by third parties as the charge for service. Private clouds are built exclusively for a specific enterprise application or in a private sector to meet enterprise needs. Hybrid Clouds is the combination of both public and private clouds. Currently the most important problem in the cloud computing is security, privacy and energy efficiency issues. SUN has recently deployed a platform the Sun-Open-Cloud-Platform [10] under Commons license. In 2011, hacking groups like Lulzsec and Anonymous provoked an Internet firestorm by hacking major Web sites like Fox.com and online services like Sony's PlayStation Network. Millions of user accounts were compromised. Usernames, passwords, home addresses and credit card information --lax Web site security often allows hackers easy access of personal information. We can blame corporations for poor security and hackers for maliciously attacking Web sites, but there's a third party often at fault in these attacks, ourselves, the users.\nIf a client tries to access data and applications irrespective of location he has a possibility of compromising on privacy data. Cloud computing Providers are in need to find an alternative ways to protect client privacy information. One way is to use authentication techniques [1] with the help of user names, passwords or with secured credentials. Another way is to employ an authorization process format such as each user can access the data and applications relevant to business or need. The question of the customer is what is the security for our data? In this issues lots of researching is going on. This paper introduces little idea of privacy for the data through the data management. This paper introduces these ideas with the help of privacy manager and risk manager. Privacy manager deals with data storage and generating key for the data. Risk manager deals with risk availability in the data that received from the cloud database. The fig 1 is given in the Google for the cloud computing architecture. To implement public-key encryption the best way to use digital certificates, which is basically a unique piece of code which says that communication is trusted, where certificate authority plays a major role in digital certificate verification.\nLastPass is a password management utility that locks all of your unique passwords behind one master password. That means you can create separate logins for e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, cloud storage. LastPass is just one example of a cloudbased service that makes managing data on the Web easier. When it comes to preserving your important pictures and files, finding the right backup services is key.",

Different dimension like storage, interface, data type synchronization are compared. Qualitative comparison framework is given by Mie. Though Siani [9] deals with privacy in cloud computing but his system does not contain any type of solution for the risk in the data from cloud.\nA Good database management Technique is provides by Bo peng and Dean [2] [6] in the form of Tplatform and Map reduces. Map Reduces Technique uses different mappers in cloud to manage database. But still a problem arises when mapping is done. Tharam Dillon, he gives a clear differentiation and relationships about Cloud computing, Service-Oriented Architecture, pervasive computing and Grid computing [7]. Where he gave a complete comparative study on few challenges towards Cloud computing. Young Choon Lee, has addressed scheduling problem as a result he presented two sets of profitdriven service request [1] scheduling algorithms which gives best results compared to other scheduling techniques implemented.",

If it is saved directly to the cloud's database without providing any security or privacy measure, then it is very easy to other users who do not know it to hack or use it. So in this proposed solution there will be a privacy manager in both client side and also in the cloud side. Cloud intelligent system uses privacy manager and risk manager. Privacy manager implements an algorithm which is used to separate the data and store those data in a random location. And those locations also will be saved in the privacy manager database. When the request is sent by the client for data processing, the algorithm will recollect the data's from the cloud database in accordance to the locations present in the privacy manager of the client side. Then those data will arrange in a proper way and then they produced to the client or user. In this transmission, data from client to cloud may cause damages to the data. To avoid those damages in privacy manager, it will contain risk manager where amount of the risk in the data will be calculated. With that calculated risk, we can avoid risks in the data which is from the cloud database. In case of risk the request is again resend to the cloud server. The private cloud architecture is given in the fig 2. The fig 2 depicts the intelligent cloud system implement with privacy manager and risk manager. ",

Fig 3 depicts the private intelligent cloud environment which communicates with public cloud where secure data can be transmitted with risk analysis. This is how secured data management or data transaction can be done via secure intelligent track. This helps each client in the private side to update their data by their own. If they need to secure their data within the private cloud means. They can create or generate their own keywords for the data which is to be secure. Each updating in privacy manager can only be done through the server of the private cloud. There will not be any kind of direct link between the client machines. This gives security to private cloud side. In this hybrid cloud, data's from the public cloud will not directly reach the client. It should pass through the privacy manager of both the private cloud and client machine, so those data will be secure.",

These location details are stored in the database of the privacy manager. In need of data, the segmented data is brought to the privacy manager, combine and given to the client. In the same diagram, data B is stored with the key1 in random location. Because data B is larger in size, in this case data are encrypted and decrypted. The memory location the data B is (1,4), (4,8), (5,6). 13. Combine the packets to form a data and deliver to the client. A sample screen shot for data retrieval is shown which gives the basic idea of how the intelligent cloud system works. After possible credential verification process the user is allowed to upload a file as given in fig 11 . Later the file goes to the cloud through privacy manager and risk manager where our intelligent track system acts. This proposed intelligent cloud system can be implemented by setting a Eucalyptus cloud environment and by using Aneka tool to import java packages to resolve the issues.  This paper implements intelligent cloud with techniques to solve the privacy and data management problem. This proposed solution can be applied to current cloud computing process. This research work carried out gives enhanced performance hence can be used for many applications like online banking, credit card transactions, where large and sensitive number of data sets need to be handled.",
