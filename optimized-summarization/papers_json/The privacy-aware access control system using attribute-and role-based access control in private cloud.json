    "abstract": "Cloud is a relatively new concept and so it is unsurprising that the information assurance, data protection, network security and privacy concerns have yet to be fully addressed. The cloud allows users to avoid upfront hardware and software investments, gain flexibility, collaborate with others, and take advantage of the sophisticated services. However, security is a huge issue for cloud users especially access control, user profile management and accessing services offered by the private cloud environment. A privacy enhancement system on Academic-based private cloud system using Eucalyptus open source cloud infrastructure has been proposed in this paper. This system provides the cloud users to improve the privacy and security of the private personal data. Two approaches (Role-based Access Control and Attribute-based Access Control model) are combined as a new approach (ARBAC). This means that they are applied to improve the privacy which supports both mandatory and discretionary access control needs on the target private cloud system.",

Today, clients are capable of running their software applications in remote computing clouds where data storage and processing resources could be acquired and released, almost, instantaneously. The virtualization layer on top of the commodity hardware in computing clouds is the driving force that allows cloud providers to \"elastically\" and promptly respond to client resource demands and requirements [8].\nIn spite of all the advantages delivered by cloud computing, the security and privacy concerns are significant challenges from the storage and processing of sensitive data on remote servers that can even not be managed by the cloud users themselves.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the related work. Section 3 mentions Privacy-aware access control system. Section 4 describes technique preliminaries. In Section 5, the proposed system is described. Finally Section 6 concludes the paper.",

Each subject has associated attributes which define the identity and characteristics of the subject. Such attributes may include the subject's identifier, name, organization, job title, and so on. Resource Attributes. A resource is an entity that is acted upon by a subject. As with subjects, resources have attributes that can be leveraged to make access control decisions. Environment Attributes. These attributes describe the operational, technical, and even situational environment or context in which the information access occurs. For example, attributes such as current date and time, the current services, and the data's security level, are not associated with a Particular subject or a resource. Policy representation can be more fine-grained within ABAC because it can be based on any combination of subject, resource, and environment attributes.",

For example:\nRole(u) = \"Student\" ServiceOwner(r) = \"UCSY\" CurrentDate(e) = \"01-23-2011\"\nIn the most general form, a Policy Rule that decides on whether a user UG 1 can access a resource R IaaS1 , R SaaS1 and R DaaS1 in a particular environment e time1 ,e location1 , is a Boolean function of s, r, and e's attributes:\nRule: can_access (u, r, e) \u2190\u0192 (ATTR(u), ATTR(r), ATTR(e))\nGiven all the attribute assignments of u, r, and e, if the function's evaluation is true, then the access to the resource is granted; otherwise the access is denied. A Policy rule base may consist of a number of policy rules, covering many subjects and resources within a security domain. The access control decision process in essence amounts to the evaluation of applicable policy rules in the policy store. For example, a rule that dictates \"Users with role 'Researcher' may access the 'Research' special cloud service\" can be written as: This example also shows that conventional RBAC rules can be accommodated by the ABAC model just as easily. For example, to enforce that a resource may only be accessed by its owners, this paper can have a rule as follows: R2: can_access (u, r, e) \u2190 (UserID(u) = ResourceOwner(r))\nR1:can_access (US 1 , R IaaS1 ,",
