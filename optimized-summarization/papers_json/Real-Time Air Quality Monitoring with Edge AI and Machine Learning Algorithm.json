    "abstract": "Real-time air quality monitoring is essential for public health and environmental protection, but typical centralized systems have latency, bandwidth, and privacy concerns. This work describes a novel approach to decentralized air quality monitoring that employs Edge AI and powerful machine learning techniques. IoT sensors outfitted with NVIDIA Jetson devices collect and evaluate air quality data locally. Machine learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), analyze pollutants including PM2.5, CO2, and NOx in real time. Implemented across 50 urban sites with varied pollution levels, the technology reduced latency by up to 75% and bandwidth use by 60% when compared to typical cloud-based solutions. The pollutant detection accuracy was evaluated against conventional reference monitors and yielded an average correlation coefficient of 0.92. This system also used federated learning to update models based on local data, improving model accuracy by up to 15% over six months. This new strategy not only increases data processing speed and accuracy, but also protects data privacy and lowers operational costs. Significant improvements in latency, bandwidth efficiency, and model accuracy demonstrate the utility of decentralized air quality monitoring systems in urban settings.",

            "text": "Air quality monitoring is critical for protecting human health and the environment, particularly in metropolitan areas where pollution levels can change dramatically [1]. Traditional centralized air quality monitoring systems, while effective, are frequently hampered by factors like as latency, excessive bandwidth use, and potential privacy concerns. These restrictions can cause delays in essential decisionmaking and inefficiencies in data processing and analysis. Recent advances in IoT and AI have sparked renewed interest in decentralized air quality monitoring. Research has focused on employing IoT sensors for localized data collecting in order to reduce latency and bandwidth requirements. The use of artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning, has showed promise in improving the accuracy and speed of air quality analysis. However, many systems continue to rely on centralized processing, limiting their real-time capabilities. Furthermore, data privacy and scalability issues exist, limiting the widespread adoption of these decentralized techniques in real applications. The role of AI in this system is to enhance real-time air quality monitoring by utilizing machine learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), for accurate pollutant detection, while Edge AI reduces latency and bandwidth consumption. This research proposes a novel decentralized methodology to overcome the constraints of existing air quality monitoring methods. This research intends to use Edge AI and advanced machine learning techniques to address latency, bandwidth consumption, and data privacy issues. This project focuses on deploying IoT sensors integrated with NVIDIA Jetson devices to gather and interpret local air quality data. This system uses machine learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to analyze pollutants in real time, including PM2.5, CO2, and NOx. The challenge, thus, revolves around improving the efficiency, accuracy, and privacy of air quality monitoring via a decentralized approach.",

These layers contribute to the extraction and refinement of features for tasks such as image recognition. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) add to this by evaluating temporal patterns, capturing trends and periodic variations in pollutant levels. RNN has 3 layers. The input layer receives the information to process, and the output layer provides the result. Data processing, analysis, and prediction take place in the hidden layer.

Unlike traditional centralized systems, which send data to a cloud server for processing, Edge AI devices process data locally [21].\nLatency Reduction: By processing data on-site, the system reduces the latency associated with transmitting data to a central server and waiting for a response. Latency can be reduced by processing data locally at each sensor site using Edge AI devices, which eliminates the need to transmit data to a central server and wait for a response. The reduced latency can be mathematically represented as follows:\nIn a centralized system:\nT Central =T Transmit + T Process + T Return (\uf031)\nIn a decentralized (edge computing) system:\nT Edge = T Process_local (\uf032)\nSince data is processed on-site:\nT Edge \u226a T Central (\uf033)\nThe reduction in latency, \u0394T, can be expressed as:\n\u0394T=T Central -T Edge (\uf034)\nT Central Total latency in a centralized system T Transmit Time taken to transmit data to the central server, T Process Time taken to process data at the central server T Return Time taken to return the processed data to the edge device. This equation shows how local processing (using edge computing) significantly reduces latency by eliminating the transmission and return times associated with centralized processing.\nBandwidth Efficiency: Decentralized processing improves bandwidth efficiency by reducing the amount of raw data that needs to be transferred over the network. In a classic centralized system, raw sensor data must be transferred to a central server for processing, which requires a large amount of bandwidth.
