    "abstract": "The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies into the lives of young digital citizens has escalated privacy concerns and the need for critical examination. This study uses Communication Privacy Management (CPM) Theory to understand how youth and critical stakeholders navigate these concerns. A total of 306 participants were surveyed, comprising 146 AI professionals, 127 parents and educators and 33 youths (aged 16-19). Employing a mixed-methods approach, the research combined quantitative data from structured questionnaires with qualitative insights from open-ended responses. Descriptive statistics reveal distinct perspectives among different demographics regarding data ownership, education, transparency and trust, parental role and perceived risks and benefits associated with AI systems. Structural equation modelling identified key influences on youth privacy management, highlighting the significance of transparency and trust, education and awareness, and parental data sharing among AI professionals, parents, educators, and young digital citizens. The qualitative analysis further underscored unique concerns, emphasizing a lack of understanding and data misuse contributed to the feeling of helplessness shared by all stakeholders. This study underscores the importance of integrating diverse stakeholders' perspectives in the development of AI systems to address the complex challenges faced by youth. Recommendations include collaborative policymaking, implementing user-centric design practices, and enhancing privacy education to empower young digital citizens.",

            "text": "The evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies has profoundly reshaped daily life, particularly for young digital citizens who are often at the forefront of adopting innovations [1], [2]. AI-driven systems ranging from virtual assistants to social media algorithms and personalized learning platforms rely heavily on extensive data collection to provide personalized experiences and improved services. These technologies undoubtedly have benefits, but they also pose serious problems concerning data ownership, privacy, and ethical use of personal data [1].\nYoung digital citizens [2] are commonly defined as digital natives growing up in a digital era where sharing personal information online over social media has become normalized. Many in this demographic have limited awareness of the complexities of data privacy and the potential long-term risks of their information disclosures. This lack of understanding leaves them particularly vulnerable to privacy breaches, identity theft and the misuse of their data. Compounding this issue, the lack of transparency and technical complexity of AI systems often hinder young users from making informed choices regarding their privacy. Even though AI is omnipresent in young digital citizens' lives, research exploring how they handle privacy issues within AI-driven environments is limited [3]. The current state of the art tends to concentrate mainly on adult populations or broad privacy issues, ignoring the difficulties that young digital citizens encounter when engaging with AI-driven platforms. This emphasizes the necessity of looking into the variables affecting how youth handle their privacy to improve policy frameworks, educational initiatives, and AI design methodologies.\nTo address this knowledge gap, this study uses the Communication Privacy Management (CPM) Theory [4] as a framework for understanding youth privacy management behaviors in AI contexts. CPM Theory emphasizes how individuals regulate the disclosure of personal information through key processes, including privacy ownership, control, rulemaking, and the management of boundary turbulence that occurs when privacy expectations are violated. This study specifically examines five variables: Data Ownership and Control (DOC), Parental Data Sharing (PDS), Perceived Risks and Benefits (PRB), Transparency and Trust (TT), and Education and Awareness (EA) [2]. Together, these constructs provide a comprehensive view of the interactions between individual perceptions, parental roles, system transparency, and educational factors in shaping privacy management behaviors. While CPM Theory has been applied in other contexts, its relevance to youth privacy management within AI environments has not yet been fully explored.\nIn this study, we gathered survey data from 306 participants, including 146 AI developers and researchers, 127 parents and educators, and 33 young digital citizens between the ages of 16 and 19. The hypotheses produced from CPM Theory were tested and the interactions between the constructs were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. This work intends to close a significant gap in the literature and offer practical suggestions for improving youth privacy management in AI contexts by fusing CPM Theory with empirical data. In addition to broadening the theoretical applicability of CPM Theory to contemporary technological contexts, this research provides insightful information for AI developers, educators, and policymakers.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: the next section provides an overview of related works and background literature. The methodologies are outlined in section III. Section IV presents the results of our study. Section V provides the discussion with recommendations for ethical AI practices, limitations, and future research direction. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.",

            "text": "Developed by Sandra Petronio [4], Communication Privacy Management (CPM) Theory serves as a foundational framework for understanding how individuals make decisions about sharing or withholding private information. CPM emphasizes that people view private information as their possession, granting them the autonomy to control and regulate its disclosure based on personal privacy rules. These privacy rules are shaped by various factors, including cultural norms, motivations, assessments of risks and benefits, and contextual circumstances [4].\nThe theory outlines some fundamental key principles that are particularly relevant to comprehending how to maintain young digital citizens' privacy in AI-driven environments:\n1) Privacy Ownership: People think they own their private information and are entitled to control how it is disclosed.\n2) Privacy Control: Techniques are used to manage the accessibility and flow of personal data.\n3) Privacy Rules: Established guidelines that take into account a variety of influencing elements serve as a reference for personal privacy decisions.\n4) Privacy Boundaries: Symbolic boundaries that assist people regulate what they share by separating private information from public information.\n5) Boundary Coordination: When private information is shared with others, there is a process of negotiation to manage shared privacy boundaries.\n6) Boundary Turbulence: When privacy norms are broken, there are disturbances that result in disagreements or the need to renegotiate privacy boundaries.",

            "text": "Data Ownership and Control (DOC) [19], [20], [21], [22] It is the degree to which young people have control over their personal data and engage in discussions about privacy.\nParental Data Sharing (PDS) [23], [24], [25] It is the degree to which parents exercise their rights to share children's data and consider the implications of doing so.\nPerceived Risks and Benefits (PRB) [22], [24], [26] It is the degree to which individuals perceive risks, ethical concerns, and benefits related to the use of personal data by AI systems. Transparency and Trust (TT) [27], [28], [29] It is the degree to which transparency in data usage influences trust in AI systems.\nEducation and Awareness (EA) [30], [31], [32], [33] It is the degree to which stakeholders are informed about privacy and ethical issues associated with AI.\nIn an era where AI systems increasingly collect and analyze personal information, youths' sense of ownership is often challenged by the opaque and complex nature of data practices [5], [6]. A strong sense of ownership is linked to privacyprotective behaviors, empowering young individuals to establish boundaries and exercise autonomy over their data [1]. However, the intricacy of AI systems and the lack of userfriendly privacy controls frequently undermine their ability to maintain such control [7]. Studies reveal that youths often have a limited understanding of data ownership, which further hampers their ability to effectively manage their privacy in AIdriven environments [8].\nAs parental involvement can be instrumental in guiding and educating children about privacy risks, it also has the potential to inadvertently undermine youths' privacy management through the over-disclosure of personal information [9]. Striking a balance between parental authority and youths' autonomy requires careful boundary coordination to ensure that privacy rights are respected. Open and effective communication between parents and their children fosters the negotiation of privacy boundaries, thereby minimizing the likelihood of boundary turbulence and associated conflicts [10].\nFurthermore, PRB plays a critical role in shaping how youth decide whether to disclose personal information to AI systems. According to CPM Theory, individuals weigh the potential benefits against the associated risks before making decisions about sharing private information [11]. For youth, the perceived advantages, such as personalized content and improved user experiences, often outweigh the concerns of risks like data breaches or misuse, prompting them to share their data more readily [12]. However, understanding how young digital citizens assess these risks and benefits is vital to developing effective strategies that support their privacy management. Studies reveal that young individuals tend to perceive risks at a lower level than adults, which can result in more permissive data-sharing behaviors [13].\nAdditionally, TT is pivotal in influencing how youth approach privacy management in AI systems. Transparent AI technologies that clearly communicate data collection and usage practices foster greater trust, encouraging users to share personal information with confidence [14]. Trust acts as a critical factor in shaping how individuals set and negotiate privacy boundaries, determining their willingness to disclose information. Conversely, a lack of transparency can erode trust, making users hesitant to engage or share data. Enhancing transparency in AI systems not only mitigates perceived risks but also establishes a foundation for stronger, more trusting relationships between youth and technology [15].\nEA also plays a critical role in equipping youth with the tools needed for effective privacy management. Within the framework of CPM, knowledge and understanding of privacy issues are essential for developing informed privacy rules and making deliberate decisions about sharing personal information [16]. Educational initiatives that focus on increasing awareness about AI technologies, data handling practices, and privacy rights empower youth to assert greater control over their personal information, reducing their susceptibility to privacy violations [17]. Research highlights that higher levels of digital literacy are associated with more cautious and thoughtful online behavior among youth, reinforcing the importance of education in promoting responsible digital engagement [18].",

This theoretical framework offers insights into how young individuals navigate privacy by examining key factors such as control over their data, parental control, risk and benefit assessments, transparency in AI systems, and awareness. Despite its significant applicability, prior research has predominantly addressed privacy concerns among adult populations within general contexts, leaving a gap in understanding the specific experiences and challenges faced by youth in AI-driven interactions [8]. This study bridges that gap by employing CPM to analyze empirical data, shedding light on the unique privacy behaviors of young digital citizens and providing valuable contributions to both theoretical discourse and actionable policy design.",

The approval with reference number #103116 was given for behavioral application/amendment forms, consent forms and questionnaires. We conducted a pilot study with six participants, including members of empirical research specialists from the University of Saskatchewan and Vancouver Island University. The pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility and duration of the research approach and refine the study design. Participants provided general feedback on the questionnaire which informed modifications and restructuring of the final survey questionnaires. The revised research model was then assessed by gathering survey data. We recruited participants through flyers, emails, personal networks, and on social networking sites, LinkedIn, and Reddit. To reach young digital citizens, we spoke with several school districts for their assistance in distributing our survey to their high-school students. Participation was entirely voluntary and did not receive any form of compensation. The participants had to read and accept a consent form to participate in the study, by submitting the consent form before starting the questionnaire participants were indicating they understood the conditions of participation in the study outlined in the consent form. We conducted online surveys through Microsoft Forms by requesting each participant to respond to the questionnaire based on our three designated demographics: AI Researchers and Developers, Teachers and Parents, and Youth aged 16-19.\nThe survey instruments are adapted from constructs validated in prior studies [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [22], [24], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]  We measured responses to the items, excluding qualitative items, on a 5-scale Likert scale. Notably, to ensure consistency in outcomes, we reversed the scale for items in PRB for AI Researchers and Developers and swapped items 1 and 2 in PDS for Young Digital Citizens to align contextually with the items in PRB and PDS for the other demographics. The open-ended questions and 2 indicators from PRB were used for qualitative analysis, while the remaining items were used for quantitative analysis.",

RESULTS\nThis study expands our previous research [34] by focusing specifically on young digital citizens, exploring their unique perspectives on privacy in AI systems alongside the insights gathered from parents/educators and AI professionals. This approach allows us to delve deeper into the privacy concerns and awareness levels of the younger demographic, highlighting their specific challenges and needs in the context of AI.\nFor data processing, Microsoft Excel was employed to manage the collected data through descriptive statistics. We consolidated data from various demographic groupsincluding educators, parents, AI professionals, and young digital citizens-into a single dataset for streamlined analysis. The analysis was conducted using a partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach via smartPLS software [35]. PLS-SEM is a robust method commonly used to estimate path coefficients in structural models, widely recognized in numerous studies [36], [37]. The SEM as suggested by [38] includes the testing of measurement models (exploratory factor analysis, internal consistency, convergent validity, Dillon-Goldstein's rho) and the structural model (regression analysis). We employed the path-weighing structural model scheme in smartPLS which provides the highest R 2 values for dependent latent variables.\nAdditionally, a nonparametric bootstrapping procedure was utilized to assess the statistical significance of the PLS-SEM results. Bootstrapping is a resampling technique that creates an empirical sampling distribution by drawing repeated samples with replacements from the original data set. For our analysis, 5,000 subsamples were generated, and a two-tailed test was conducted at a significance level of 0.1.\nWe also conducted a thematic analysis of open-ended questions to identify common themes expressed by participants.",

Item tt2 had a low loading value of 0.344 which would suggest that it be avoided in the model. Although we did use the validated constructs, our exploratory analysis showed that tt2 had a weak influence on Trust and Transparency. Item doc1 had a factor loading value of 0.536, which is just under the significant level of 0.60, which is still deemed moderately acceptable [39].",

AVE should exceed 0.50, indicating that 50% of the variance in the items is captured by the hypothesized constructs, and CR should be above 0.75 [40]. In our study, AVE exceeded 0.50 for all constructs except for Trust and Transparency (TT) and Data Ownership and Control (DOC), which also had CR values slightly below 0.75. TT, with an AVE of 0.449 and CR of 0.686, suggests that it did not capture significant variance to converge into a single construct.   [41]. DOC achieved a rho_A of 0.510, suggesting moderate reliability. EA scored 0.622, also reflecting moderate reliability. PDS scored 2.062, which is above the acceptable range. This indicates significant variation within the response items, most likely due to the combination of all three demographics, students, parents/educators, and AI developers/researchers, who may have differing opinions. In contrast, PRB exhibited a low score of 0.197, suggesting poor reliability and questioning its appropriateness for inclusion in further analysis. Finally, TT achieved a rho_A of 0.529, indicating moderate reliability.\nOverall, while most constructs exhibited acceptable levels of reliability, the PRB and PDS constructs may require reconsideration in future analyses due to their scores.",

The R 2 values indicate the variance explained in each construct by its antecedents, while the \u03b2 values measure the strength of relationships between constructs. P-values assess the statistical significance of these relationships. According to Chin's guideline [24], [43], a \u03b2 should be at least 0.2 to be considered relevant. Following guidelines from [24], [43], a model is considered statistically somewhat significant (*p) with a p-value < 0.1, quite significant (**p) with a p-value < 0.01, and highly significant (***p) with a p-value < 0.001.   Direct effects analysis showed that EA significantly and positively affects DOC (\u03b2 = 0.329; p < 0.001) and PRB (\u03b2 = 0.524; p < 0.001), supporting hypotheses H1 and H12. In contrast, PDS exhibits a significant negative impact on DOC (\u03b2 = -0.170; p < 0.01), leading us to partially reject H6 as the effect, though significant, is negative. TT also shows a positive influence on DOC (\u03b2 = 0.300; p < 0.001) and a moderately positive effect on PRB (\u03b2 = 0.300; p < 0.1), affirming hypotheses H3 and H10. However, the relationships between PRB and DOC (\u03b2 = 0.037; p > 0.1) and between PDS and EA (\u03b2 = -0.034; p > 0.1) did not reach significance, resulting in the rejection of hypotheses H2, H7, and H9.\nThe explanatory power of the model is noteworthy, with EA, TT, PDS, and PRB explaining 32.2% of the variance in DOC (R\u00b2 = 0.322), and EA and TT explaining 33.4% of the variance in PRB (R\u00b2 = 0.334). PDS, however, accounts for only a minimal 0.1% of the variance in EA (R\u00b2 = 0.001).\nExamining the indirect effects, the analysis indicated that the pathway from PDS to DOC via EA was not significant (\u03b2 = -0.011; p > 0.1), leading to the rejection of hypothesis H8. Similarly, the indirect pathway from EA to DOC via PRB was insignificant (\u03b2 = 0.020; p > 0.1), resulting in the rejection of hypothesis H4. Furthermore, the mediation from TT to DOC through PRB was also not supported (\u03b2 = 0.005; p > 0.1), rejecting hypotheses H5 and H11. Despite EA's direct impact on DOC, its indirect influence through PRB is unsupported, leading to the rejection of hypothesis H13.\nThese findings elucidate the complex interplay between educational awareness, trust, perceived risks, and parental influences in shaping data ownership and control among youth. Future research should expand on these findings with longitudinal data to better understand the dynamic changes and causal relationships over time.",

We further explored the viewpoints of educators, parents, AI professionals, and young digital citizens, examining open-ended survey responses to identify common themes around privacy concerns, which include lack of awareness, data misuse, and feelings of loss of control. In line with the prior findings [44], Young digital citizens repeatedly expressed a limited understanding of AI data practices, highlighting significant gaps in their knowledge and awareness. For example, one young participant remarked, \"I do not know enough about them to be concerned about what I should be concerned about\" (#Participant 1). This feeling was shared by parents and educators who expressed concern about the potential dangers of uninformed data sharing in regards to children's safety. A concerned parent noted, \"Unauthorized access to personal data can harm children in ways they don't even understand yet\" (#Participant 2).\nThe misuse of data was a critical concern shared by all participants who expressed worry about how their information might be exploited. A youth participant expressed unease about corporate misuse of data, stating, \"What worries me is the companies involved selling, and storing my data for purposes other than personalizing\" (#Participant 3). An AI researcher pointed out a systemic liability, adding, \"Once data is shared, there's no going back. Misuse becomes inevitable\" (#Participant 4).\nAll three demographics expressed the feeling of powerlessness over the control of personal information being used by AI systems. One educator criticized the excessive demand for data, stating, \"AI systems ask for too much data, more than they need to serve their purpose\" (#Participant 5). Echoing this concern, a young participant reflected: \"AI collects too much personal stuff. Most of us don't know what they do with the data, which feels like losing control\" (#Participant 6).\nThese findings emphasize the challenges associated with the CPM framework concepts of boundary turbulence and privacy control. The responses highlight an urgent need for increased transparency, trust, and education to empower all stakeholders to manage their privacy more effectively in AI environments.",

Additionally, the crosssectional design only offers a snapshot in time, constraining our ability to make causal inferences and capture the evolving nature of privacy attitudes and behaviors. Future research could benefit from employing random sampling methods and longitudinal designs to validate these results across a more diverse range of populations. Additionally, the moderate reliability of some constructs, particularly Trust and Transparency (TT) with an AVE of 0.449 and a CR of 0.686, suggests a need for methodological refinement to more accurately capture the complexities of privacy management behaviors within AI contexts.

Data was collected using survey instruments, refined with a pilot study, and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The resulting model shows that EA significantly influences DOC and PRB, underscoring the critical importance of privacy education in facilitating more effective boundary management strategies. Similarly, TT positively influences DOC, reinforcing the role of transparency in building trust and reducing boundary turbulence. However, the minimal mediation of PRB and the negative effect of PDS on DOC underscore the complexity of privacy behaviors, suggesting external factors like parental dynamics and usability concerns may play critical roles. These results emphasize the need for user-centric privacy controls, tailored transparency mechanisms, and collaborative educational initiatives to empower stakeholders and reduce privacy risks. While this research advances the application of CPM Theory to AI contexts, future studies should expand demographic diversity, refine constructs for improved reliability, and explore longitudinal shifts in privacy behaviors to further inform privacy-centric AI system designs.",

The model explores both direct and indirect effects among these constructs.Direct effects analysis showed that EA significantly and positively affects DOC (\u03b2 = 0.329; p < 0.001) and PRB (\u03b2 = 0.524; p < 0.001), supporting hypotheses H1 and H12. In contrast, PDS exhibits a significant negative impact on DOC (\u03b2 = -0.170; p < 0.01), leading us to partially reject H6 as the effect, though significant, is negative. TT also shows a positive influence on DOC (\u03b2 = 0.300; p < 0.001) and a moderately positive effect on PRB (\u03b2 = 0.300; p < 0.1), affirming hypotheses H3 and H10. However, the relationships between PRB and DOC (\u03b2 = 0.037; p > 0.1) and between PDS and EA (\u03b2 = -0.034; p > 0.1) did not reach significance, resulting in the rejection of hypotheses H2, H7, and H9.The explanatory power of the model is noteworthy, with EA, TT, PDS, and PRB explaining 32.2% of the variance in DOC (R\u00b2 = 0.322), and EA and TT explaining 33.4% of the variance in PRB (R\u00b2 = 0.334). PDS, however, accounts for only a minimal 0.1% of the variance in EA (R\u00b2 = 0.001).Examining the indirect effects, the analysis indicated that the pathway from PDS to DOC via EA was not significant (\u03b2 = -0.011; p > 0.1), leading to the rejection of hypothesis H8. Similarly, the indirect pathway from EA to DOC via PRB was insignificant (\u03b2 = 0.020; p > 0.1), resulting in the rejection of hypothesis H4. Furthermore, the mediation from TT to DOC through PRB was also not supported (\u03b2 = 0.005; p > 0.1), rejecting hypotheses H5 and H11. Despite EA's direct impact on DOC, its indirect influence through PRB is unsupported, leading to the rejection of hypothesis H13.These findings elucidate the complex interplay between educational awareness, trust, perceived risks, and parental influences in shaping data ownership and control among youth. Future research should expand on these findings with longitudinal data to better understand the dynamic changes and causal relationships over time.",
