            "      \"content\": \"This paper proposes a novel approach for multi-party collaborative data analysis problems, where analysis accuracy and divergence are required, as well as both privacy of shared data and explainability of results. The proposed approach aims at trading-off data privacy, decision explainability, and data utility by analytically relating these three measures, evaluating how they impact each other, and proposing a methodology to find the best possible tradeoff among them. In particular, given a set of requirements from the participants for a collaborative analysis problem, we propose a method to properly tune the parameters of privacy-preserving mechanisms and explainability techniques to be adopted by all participants, obtaining the best trade-off. The paper is focused on deep learning-based image data analysis probl\n"
